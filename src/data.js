    "A Halfling Artificer and Tinker, with a broad smile and gregarious nature. He produces intricate, ingenious mechanical devices for adventurers. The shop he operates out of is built-to-halfling-scale, though. To broaden his customer base, he has fitted every shelf, display, and even the front wall of the building with a complex system of rails and slides, allowing him to do business with anyone, and display anything, all at the customer’s eye level.",
    "What appears to be an EXTREMELY tall halfling woman, but when she walks around the counter, she is simply wearing the tallest pair of platform shoes you’ve ever seen. All she sells is shoes. Some of the shoes are enchanted, but many are just ‘fashionable’.",
    "A tortle that, when it approaches, it appears the shell has been carved to look like tattoos. When he speaks, he has a deep slow tone to his voice (imagine Johnny Cash). He sells books and scrolls and writing equipment. He is never in a rush to make a sale as he enjoys the act of bartering but always ensures he makes a profit. His stock often holds rare or even forbidden books. When asked, he will just shrug and say something about not knowing or forgetting the book was there. He of course houses lots of spell scrolls at different levels and will even sell a few spellbooks from wizards that gave either passed or given up that life.",
    "Bobbik and Bimbeck’s Curiosities: Mr. Bobbik is a bespectacled Beholder with a friendly and inquisitive nature. A true oddity in his species and as such shunned entirely from polite underdark society. In his travels, he met Mr. Bimbeck, who was exploring caverns looking for interesting rocks and a lifelong friendship was formed. The two of them sell all manner of strange and unique things. They probably don’t have EXACTLY what you are looking for, but they certainly have something of interest. Example Inventory: A potted plant with a bell on it (So it can’t sneak up on you), a warhammer that you can fill with angry bees, Aardvark poison, Aardvark medicine, a clockwork thing you don’t know what it does that has a bell on it so it can’t sneak up on you.",
    "Sister Elma: She claims to be a Nun and sells holy symbols and dubious reliquaries to travelers. Example Inventory: Martyr’s Big Toe on a string, desicrated left testicle of a legendary bard, mostly accurate holy symbols at discount prices, bag of bones from a legendary warrior (or a chicken, depending on perception checks).",
    "Bob and Rob Oblah (And Hobble their Goblin assistant): An Ettin with 4 eyes for values! Not the brightest, but with a natural sense for what things are worth and if they are being cheated or short-changed. The two heads can be played off of each other in the process of haggling. Hobble the Goblin mostly just stares daggers at the customer and polishes the counter. Example Inventory: Magic Items, hand made Goblin crafts.",
    "A new gnomish invention that automatically dispenses a piece of gum that works as a healing potion if the proper amount of gold is inserted. Roll a d20 when using the machine. On a 20, two pieces of gum come out. On a 1 the machine jams and no gum comes out. Has tamper resistance enchantments that destroy the gum if the machine is broken into.",
    "A dwarven barber that uses magical shears. Cuts their client’s hair to be longer, not shorter.",
    "A Tabaxi merchant sells beautiful glassware and fine china, things that an adventurer would probably never use. Symbols on his shop in thieves’ cant suggest he may also be a fence, although they are confusing, crossed out and re-written. The Tabaxi, a dark-coated young merchant named Many Hidden Knives, is boisterous and eager to gossip.",
    "The shopkeeper is clearly two gnomes with one on the other’s shoulders, but they will never admit it. The two, Foggi Ysbeten and Grogel Grogelhome, take turns being the one on top, but never acknowledge the difference. They sell ‘human-sized’ equipment.",
    "The Broad’s Boards: An extremely tall, stunningly attractive blonde woman named Nyss sells shields of different makes and models. Has some magic shields, some bucklers, and some tower shields too big for the average man.",
    "A Goliath, considered large even among his own tall people, known only as ‘The Builder.’ He crafts intricate toys, gadgets, and trinkets. Working from inside a wagon pulled by two Clydesdale horses, he hunches over his desk with a lantern and a magnifying glass, working his massive fingers to build tiny, detailed devices. If he meets a child, he always gives them a toy for free. He never accepts gold as payment, only more materials for crafting, or if the need arises, a personal favor. He can be commissioned to build specific devices, but prefers not to unless he knows the person well. He sticks to rural towns and villages and defends himself with a myriad of clockwork like devices that are beyond most people’s understanding.",
    "Azaeli, A devilish tradesmen. A man of true evil. Holds some of the best gear around and sells them very low as well, but they come at a cost, Azaeli gives the buyer a quest of true evil intentions. Rather it be spreading a plague, or allowing crime syndicates to florish, a seemingly useless action that has large impact on the nearby areas. Azaeli has a pair of seemingly burning eyes, is often found to be wearing a top hat and very expensive silk clothing. In his backstory Azaeli, was once a normal True neutral, human warlock, until one day Azaeli attempted to banish a powerful demon. It succeeded but as soon as he cast it he was possessed causing a merge of souls. Azaeli became a devilish sellsman who roams the globe causing mayhem.",
    "Whilst walking through through the run down boroughs of a large city you spy a strange exchange down one of the numerous labyrinthine alleys. A rather large and motley crow sits upon a busted crate. At the base of the crate an alley cat, accompanied by a scraggly litter of kittens, approaches the crow and drops what looks to be a shiny piece rubbish. You look on as both the cat and the crow seem to converse, the low cawing of the crow meeting the desperate meows of the cat. Eventually some sort of accord seems to be struck, and the crow produces a large half eaten fish, dragging it from the crate and letting it plop down on the dirty ground bellow. Immediately the mother alley cat picks up the fish and darts off, her kittens tumbling along behind her. Those who wish to stay and observe the crow for longer will discover that all manner of strays, ferals and other wild denizens of the alleys approach the crow throughout the day, including one or two beggars and street kids. Each time something shiny is produced, and an item from the box given. Sometimes food, sometimes junk, and at one point even a dagger (given to a street kid) is pulled from the crate. At sundown several more crows gather at the spot in the alley and begin to fuss around the crate. Eventually they all take flight, labouring under a sack clearly laden with goods. They cary the sack high above the roof tops, eventually disappearing from sight, their mysterious trade having officially closed for the day.",
    "A series of animals who seem to run every magic shop the party goes’s to. They’re capable of communicating via telepathy, but mostly prefer to make animal noises. Probably the familiars of some old mage.",
    "A very short wizened old man with a wispy mustache. He runs a pet shop and seems to always be talking to himself. When someone enters his shop he will grab them by the elbow and begin walking them around to all the cages and kennels and tanks. No matter what they say, he’ll respond with things like ‘Yes, he is a bit tall, isn’t he?’ or ‘Now don’t be rude, he doesn’t smell that bad.’ or ‘Ah yes, I remember. You don’t want a single pet, you want to adopt a whole family.’ Finally he gets to one animal and says ‘Eh? This one looks good to you? Excellent!’ He then picks them up out of the cage, hands them to the person – again, regardless of whatever the person is saying – and then says ‘Now there is just the little matter of payment …’. Which is when the animal bites or claws the person and then gives the store owner a single drop of blood. Because he doesn’t sell pets to people, he sells people to pets."

    "Bog Grog – A mix of Rum, Orange Juice and fermented herbs that, when drunk, causes the user to gain advantage on saving throws against being poisoned for 30 minutes.",
    "Frost Mead – Honey and the tear of an Ice Giant make this shot. The crackling blue sparkle and the jet of icy breath you have for rest of the day is worth the expense.",
    "Weatherbee’s Whirler – Invented by the perhaps too inventive Filbus Weatherbee, this drink is testimony as to why it is a bad idea to point a gnome’s sharp mind towards the creation of a new brew. After spending many years living among the dwarves, Weatherbee made his way home with a drink even the stout folk couldn’t handle. This monstrosity is laced with latent magic designed to lessen the chance of drinkers dying from its ungodly alcohol content, and reportedly tastes like “A kick in the face from a horse.” After one shot of this drink, the drinker is shunted into a chaotic haze of blurry awareness, bolstered confidence, and overpowering drunkenness. In addition, the latent magic in the brew causes minor, uncontrolled magical effects to occur around the drinker at random times during the haze. The nature of these effects is up to either the DM or the player, so long as the effects are sufficiently insignificant. After 1d4 hours, the haze drops away and the drinker immediately and almost violently falls into a deep sleep so that they may recover.",

    "Elysium – a nonalcoholic drink that smells and looks as bad as it tastes. Some compared it to trash, vomit or even excrement but only because they couldn’t find the adequate foul words. Most refuse to look at it, let alone allow it to come close to their nose. Only those with the strongest will manage to gulp it down. Once drunk, the person experiences true bliss, which seems to last for decades. In reality it’s a few seconds.",
    "Nine Steps – commonly known as ‘The Niner’ or by it’s full name ‘Nine Steps to Hell’. It is a liquid that when left to settle separates into 9 parts, the bottom one being pure black and the top a beautiful red with a gradient in between. After drinking it the person seems frozen for a few seconds, but to the person who gulpes it down it feels like days, weeks, maybe even months of 9 different experiences, all basically a form of torture. Often used as a torture method but sometimes drunk to prove ones mental strenght, as those that can’t endure it go insane. The niner is a rare drink because it’s extremely hard to make. An amateur making it, if the ingridients aren’t correct to the milligram, makes a drink that causes instant death.",
    "Honey Pine Dew – An imported halfling mead, served in small cups. Very pleasant taste, cheap in halfling towns, but expensive elsewhere.",

Soft, upbeat music is constantly being played by a talented bard in one of the room’s corners, which somehow gives the caster a feeling of home. There are always enough patrons that the inn feels lively but not uncomfortably crowded, and waiters and waitresses bustle around providing delicious drinks and hearty meals. An innkeeper immediately rushes over to the caster and informs them that their room has been covered, as well as all their food and drink. As the inn’s fare fills the caster’s belly and the patrons begin to socialize with them, the caster becomes less and less inclined to leave. In actuality, the inn and all its original occupants are part of a small sentient pocket dimension that feeds off of feelings of contentment and satisfaction. The pocket dimension snatched the caster up in the hopes of keeping them inside it as a permanent source of sustenance. Exiting through the far door instantly transports the caster to their intended destination.",

You can see where they they are, floating as specters/ghosts. But as soon as you attempt to approach them, you feel you soul and body get hot as your dragged away and teleported to the original desired location. No time has passed since.

    "Abbysal: 66.6% of all blood for the next googol of years or the end of the claimant’s life, whichever comes last, must be left at a altar to dark powers.

The bard will mention everyone, including you, but your stanza will be just that much less remarkable than the others. This only applies to secondhand accounts: anyone who witnesses your deeds will see them as they truly are. Complication: The fiend itself is a Glory Leech, and its sustenance is the renown of those it gives contracts to. After you’ve done enough deeds, and the Glory Leech has nourished itself on your relinquished fame, it has the strength to take your place…either actually possessing you, or manifesting as the ideal version of you who everyone unrelated sees as having really done all your great deeds.",
    "The fiend requires as its price that you have a recurring cold. It doesn’t hamper you mechanically (or perhaps gives only a small disadvantage to pure CON checks, of which there are few), but you are Always. Sick. Your companions notice it, NPCs notice it; it feels like you have Fantasy Allergies and no restorative magic can remove it. Complication: The fiend had a powerful curse bestowed upon itself, and has found a way to gradually rerout and ‘metabolize’ that curse through you. After 1/5/10/50 years of dealing with this cold, one day you wake up to find that it is gone once and for all. However, the fiend is now no longer restrained by its curse. It shows up to thank you for your assistance…and perhaps, for good or ill, it does something more.",
    "The fiend wants your nickname. If you have multiple nicknames, it will demand one that has emotional or personal significance, though not necessarily your most cherished one. Complication: true names have power, but nicknames have their own, weaker power. The fiend is able to summon you to its infernal realm every so often, as per some backwards summoning spell. You appear as a ghostly form and can’t be permanently injured, though you may have to fight or undergo tasks. The fiend can’t torture you or hurt you willingly, but it can command you to perform duties as a summoned creature would.",
    "The fiend wants one fingernail from your non-dominant hand. It pulls them out with a pair of shiny, black pliers. The fingernail never grows back. Complication: that’s a really damn creepy thing to ask for. Why in the Nine Hells did they want a fingernail? What are they doing with it? Ugh. That’s gonna bother you.",

If you are a spellcaster or other magic user, all of your magical effects get noticeably dimmer , though no harder to perceive i.e. this doesn’t change them to Subtle Spell. If you cast a spell that produces light as an intended effect (the Light cantrip, Daylight, Moonbeam, Sunburst, etc., though up to DM discretion), either the radius of light is lowered, or one damage die from the spell’s damage is demoted/removed entirely. If you’re a non-caster, your torches sputter and go out much faster than others’ do, and any magic items you use that are designed to cast light are reduced in radius.",
    "The fiend picks up a small rock off the ground and enchants it with a spell you cannot discern (on a successful Arcana check or casting of detect magic, you realize it’s from the Divination school). The fiend then demands that you always keep this rock on your person. You are magically bound to this: if the rock is left behind or discarded, it returns to your pack whenever you aren’t paying attention. The rock is always there and tends to get in the way, but imposes no mechanical penalties. Complication: The rock is a powerful scrying stone, and the fiend is able to watch you at any time, for as long as it wishes. Not only does the fiend enjoy spying on the Material Plane, but it has also been known to rent out the use of this rock to other fiends. Anyone who uses the rock cannot directly harm you or your companions…though nothing stops them from screwing with you in potentially terrible ways.",

    "Demon Only: The demon states that the player’s fee is waived, as the demon insert excuse here [likes them/is feeling generous/was or will be paid for doing the task/etc.]. As a token of the contract, the player must place a small scrap of moss in an obscure window frame, preferably in a ruin. The demon will attempt to deceive the player if asked about it, saying it’s a form of ritual in it’s ‘layer’ (means nothing in the abyss) to ensure a contract is completed. Complication: the scrap of moss is a fledgeling demon [if D&D, Alkilith from Mordenkainen’s Tome of Foes], and a portal to the Abyss. It can be recognized as fiendish by abilities or spells, and very few hit points. If left unchecked for d10 years, the moss will overgrow the window and open a gate to the Abyss.",

The hermit was cursed centuries ago, locked away, stripped of all their power by a local shaman to wither and die. The hermit was a Hag Mother whose curse can only be broken by receiving an honest gift from a mortal (which would never happen under normal conditions due to her blood thrist and malice), which through proper coaching from the [Evil being], you’ve just broken.",

Left out of stories, memories, often surprise people you are in the middle of conversations with when you speak even if you haven’t moved (‘OMG Gorgan, I didn’t see you there, dont sneak up on me like that’). Since you don’t seem to block light, you are often colder than normal and animals often don’t like to be in your presence.",
    "The PC will have to surrender the soul of their most beloved one. Wife, to child, to best friend. The Demon demands it for the contract to be fully bound. If the contract is broken, the soul is sent to the deepest depths of hell. But if the contract is completed to satisfaction, the soul is returned, after being exposed to hell for maybe a day to a week.",
    "A long term (read: perpetual) loan agreement. On the 6th day of the month, you must deposit a coinpurse with 66 gold pieces in it into a baroque ritual box. When closed, the box consumes the coins. Woe betide you should you come short on your payment. Mammon’s approach to debt restructuring is more cruel than any mortal moneylender.",
    "Your most precious memory and the memories required to make sense of it. Sets up for a great revealed twist in the PC’s own backstory.",
    "Your true name. The demon takes possession of your name, and can use it as a source of power over you. Whenever someone calls you by your true name you take 1d4 psychic damage.",
    "A small metal rod from the material plane. This is to serve as material component for Plane Shift to his other followers.",
    "The demon just wants a friend. No tricks, no gimmicks, they’ve just become so lonely that they’re willing to open up the possibility of having a mortal friend. They’ll check in with the player from time to time, ask how they’re doing, maybe even offer help or ask a favor of their own. (this one’s devious, because the player will constantly think and be waiting for an ulterior motive, and questioning somebody who actually just wants friendship).",
    "Just one eye. Turns out the eyes are the window to the soul, but the fiend only needs it cranked open halfway to see in. Giving up your eye tells the fiend your alignment, which in turn makes it easy for them to then exploit that knowledge to slowly bend you to their own alignment, so that when you die your soul goes to Hell/The Abyss and they can claim it as their own.",
    "Place a fist sized rock on a cobblestone bridge at exactly 9am tomorrow. Unknown to the player, a very important noble has fallen deathly ill and the cure will pass over the bridge on its way to the castle. The rock causes just enough of a delay that the noble dies, leaving their heir, a devote of said Demon/Devil in power.",
    "A wager: If the player dies in the next (X) days, the demon gets his or her soul. If the player manages to survive, the demon gets nothing. The demon cannot directly harm the player, but will do everything else within its power to see that the player meets an untimely end.",
    "Your thirdborn son. Whatever you were getting in the contract wasn’t worth a first or second born child.",
    "You must defile three holy sites of three different deities, the closer to Lawful Good the better. Preferably done by a less experienced demon/devil that uses brute force to gain influence instead of subjugation and trickery.",
    "The devil wants you to set him up in business. S/he will grant your boon in return for: a nice townhouse, endowed with sufficient capital that the maintenance and servants are paid in perpetuity; a shop in the poshest market square; the services for five years of a master in that trade (to teach it to the devil); an endowment for food, drink, etc., all top of the line; the tools, materials and capital sufficient for the trade; your enthusiastic marketing of his/her business; etc. This is a straight-up deal; the devil is sick of the politics of hell and just wants to live a mortal lifetime as a trader in [your pick, something fairly mundane, like tailor or mercer]. It’s gonna cost you way more gold than you might originally think, but you’ll get that boon fair and square. Now, the devil doesn’t intend to deal in souls, but business is business, and if something comes up that can be done subtly…",
    "The head of a well-known and beloved holy leader/monk whose God opposes the demon/devil.",
    "For you to carry a mysterious egg and protect it. Unknown to the players, the egg comes closer to hatching every time something dies within 30ft of it and players close to it gradually gain a small amount fire damage on their attacks. Egg can hatch into a physical form for the demon or a monster of your choice (friendly or not).",
    "Wants to watch you sleep and consume your dreams. Promises it will only take one night. But the next morning, the character finds that she remembers all her dreams… But her goals and motivations in life (which are another kind of ‘dreams’)? Those are gone. Forever. Character can develop other dreams (goals, motivations) but the ones that were taken can never be pursued again. Because the character simply doesn’t care about them anymore. This can be very broad. For example, if the character was especially greedy about loot and gold… well, that’s not the case anymore. Or limited to character specific quests only. The character doesn’t care about the mystery of who killed her parents, for example.",
    "The carcasses of 49 cats, to be delivered in a single bulk payment.",
    "Your Name: Your name is erased from your memory, and that of any who know you, and any written work, such as non-demonic contracts.",
    "Your lineage.",
    "Love – The fiend has either grown sentimental/nostalgic over a past life where he could love, or he simply wants to know what all the fuss is about. While you retain control, he experiences life through your heart and soul for one week. You can feel his presence and hear his whisper as he urges you to spend time with your loved ones, possibly threatening them if you don’t do as he says.",
    "Faith – The fiend tells you a secret truth that shakes your faith in a deity or ideal that you hold most valuable. You are cursed with never being able to speak it, or perhaps simply nobody believes you, but you know it to be true.",
    "Power – The fiend believes in equal exchange. If your contract is for political power, he takes your physical/magical power, and vice versa. The magnitude of the deal must remain equal on each side. If you can give him someone else’s power, that’s fine too, as the two signatories still ended up with a balanced deal.",
    "Gore – The fiend asks you to spill lots of blood for him. Not now, but over time. He just likes blood and guts, and now you’re starting to like it too. Everything you kill, you have an urge to mutilate, and every so often, you see the face of the fiend smiling up at you from a pool of blood.",
    "The devil challenges the claimant to a test of skill and talent. PC has 6 days to prepare for this contest in whatever way they see fit. On the day of the contest, they must beat an appropriate DC [50?] – if they succeed, they win, free and clear, a valuable prize thematically suited to skill tested- but if not, the devil gets the PC’s soul. PC’s party has a number of days/weeks/months to retrieve the claimant’s soul from the thematically appropriate hell before it is lost forever.",
    "For every favor you ask for from the demon, the demon takes 5% of your remaining life span. This doesn’t stack, it just continues to take 5% every time. If you have 70 years left, it takes 3.5 for the favor. If you used another favor immediately after that, it takes away 5% of the 66.5 years left remaining.",
    "The Demon/devil asks for the left shoe of every creature or person you kill. This is just for spite.",
    "The devil stores a soul in the character for safekeeping. This soul may occasionally force the player to commit evil acts. Later you can have a powerful warlock hunt the character intending to retrieve the soul.",
    "The character gets the halfling lucky trait but for a roll of 20 instead of 1. The fiend is siphoning their luck for unknown reasons.",
    "If the character ever verbally expresses love for another person, that person will be filled with hatred towards the character.",
    "A cult that worships the devil has been infiltrated by a holy paladin. The devil requests they find and kill this paladin before the devil is banished. (It is also to be assumed that this devil will provide reasonable assistance.)",
    "The devil brands the player with their symbol. That character is now sensitive to sunlight and vulnerable to radiant damage, any healing they receive from a good-aligned divine power is halved, good clerics might instinctively think the character is evil, etc.",
    "The character must mark every living creature they kill with the symbol of the devil they entered the contract with. After an hour the bodies are summoned to the devil who does what it pleases with the corpses.",
    "A cult worships the devil whose contract the character signs, and the devil asks the character to eradicate this cult. It turns out the cult was rather annoying and the devil just didn’t want to be summoned so often.",
    "The fiend needs four waterskins of blood from four specific creatures. The blood will be used to create a powerful ‘pet’ for the fiend which may or may not attack the character later on.",
    "The fiend asks that you irreparably break the trust of someone who is dear to you. Who’s trust you betray is up to you, but the fiend can tell by reading your soul whether the bond was strong or if the betrayal was true. The trust must be shattered irreversibly; if even a small amount of faith remains between you and your dear one, the fiend will not consider the condition met.",
    "The fiend insists on a request that has two parts. Firstly, you must capture the soul of someone you truly love and bring it to the fiend. The specific person or method of capture does not matter, just that they are important to you. Secondly, you must design a torment for the fiend that you believe would be the most excruciating for that particular person. The fiend expects you to use your knowledge of the person to assist you in your torture-crafting, and if it determines that you did not put your best effot into personalizing their eternal suffering, you fail the condition. If the fiend approves your torment, it sees to it that it is administered to the person’s soul for all eternity, leaving you and them mired in the knowledge that you are responsible for their everlasting pain.",
    "The fiend requests the soul of an innocent child from an enlightened race, personally slain by a sworn defender of the innocent. How the situation arose or how the soul is delivered do not matter; the fiend only cares that the circumstances set forth in its condition are met. The fiend may increase what it offers in exchange if you personally and purposefully create the circumstances that cause the slaying, with its pleasure deepening the more dramatic the conditions of the death.",
    "Your skill. The infernal takes one of your skill proficiencies (DMs choice). Not only does your skill drop to +0, but you are (meta-game) literally unable to ever pass that kind of skill check ever again. Any magical bonuses, additional modifiers, later level placements all become null.",
    "A part of your personal essence. Infernal takes from you a stat points.",
    "Your memories. Infernal takes from you all or specific memories from the PC. They choose memories specific to your character like “every memory of a loved one” so they are a stranger to you, where something specific is located like the magical mcguffin on their quest, a learned action such as a class power or magical spell (never able to be learned again), or for fun and games, basic knowledge like horses exists or that you cant breath underwater. MORE MALICIOUS VARIANT: The Infernal doesn’t care what memory they take, the whole contract was so that when they scan your memory for “which memory they want”, they actually get to see hidden information you wouldn’t have volunteered.",
    "A year of service.",
    "Your word of honor… Literally. You can no longer say the word honor.",
    "I demand your sword and shield, at a time of my choosing. This debt will be paid 3 times. So, mid fight, our plucky hero swings their mighty sword only to see it vanish before their eyes. As a member of a party, the protection of his allies is his shield and he watches them vanish too, off to fight some ancient foe of the Demon while he stands here unarmed against what was once an easy encounter…",

    "A child’s innocence. You needn’t give it to the demon, but you must take it away.",
    "The demon wants the ability to ‘sleep’. This demon lost its own ability to sleep in a different deal with another group of adventurers. You no longer need to sleep, but never truly feel ‘rested’. Should you ever have the need to go unconscious, you are semi-aware, just unable to move.",
    "The emotion in your voice. From now on, you speak in a monotone voice no matter your feelings.",
    "You must mildly inconvenience a specific person before a specific time, enough to delay them no less than 5 minutes. The demon may or may not inform you the target has a very important destiny they are unaware of, but hinges on them arriving at their destination before a specific time.",
    "You must enter a church and convince a specific clergyman to step outside the walls of the church, where the demon awaits.",
    "There’s an upcoming election and you must vote for or endorse the candidate of the demon’s choosing.",
    "The dying scream of a God. Good luck figuring out which one to kill … and then figuring out how to kill a god.",
    "You must gain the trust of an innocent, and then brutally break it. The demon doesn’t particularly need anything, he just wants to cause havoc.",
    "The fiend wants to see the material plane. In exchange for its favor, it gets to hitch a ride behind your eyes for a time. While it is there, you will trip any spell, ability, or creature that detects the presence of evil and/or fiends. You cannot enter holy sites whose alignment is not adjacent to that of the fiend. Further, it may be manipulating your dreams for its own purposes.",
    "An arm and a leg. They don’t care whose.",
    "You must aid a devil by infiltrating a church, temple or holy place with his minions. This will utterly and permanently corrupt the very foundation of an otherwise righteous institution.",
    "The fiend asks you to plant a black, spiny seed the size of a human thumb in the middle of a lush, green, verdant forest. Given d4 days to sprout, it will slowly begin to devour the local ecosystem as it grows into a massive knotted tangle of black, greasy vines with finger-length thorns. In d6 years, an area of roughly 3 square miles is converted into an Abyss-like landscape. All wildlife there becomes tainted and demonic, and demons frequently appear there.",
    "A weapon granted to you by the demon hungers for life; if you don’t use it to end a life twice per six days, the weapon turns on you and begins feasting on your flesh, dealing d10 damage and forcing a -3 penalty to STR and DEX on you until you kill something.

    "In every plate of food you eat you find one maggot.",
    "Your resurrection was more like having your soul photocopied, and the result is an inexact duplicate. You are slightly paler, and your features ever so slightly distorted (minor disfigurations to face, limbs, etc.). These effects worsen with each subsequent resurrection. Every 1d4+1 resurrections, you lose a random body part (finger, kidney, lose a leg but keep the foot, etc.) due to generation loss.",
    "Your breath become unbearable. Characters become more difficult to persuade as the conversation unfolds. No effect on intimidation.",

    "You’re living on borrowed time : every person who was present when you were resurrected now ages twice as fast, allowing you to live.",
    "To allow you to come back, Death had to take someone else’s life. Since it has a sick sense of humor, it took the life of the person you love most, and won’t ever give it back."

NOW the headache hits: this is a hangover only in the sense that the plague is an illness. You are in your only set of fine clothes, now ruined: smeared with mud, dung, broken eggs, straw and the thick, pungent smell of the jug of mysterious liquor you now remember that guy in the hat insisting you drink. A couple of hens peck the ground near your feet. You vomit in the dust and straw in front of you: the chickens investigate. You wash out your mouth with the last sip of stale water from your canteen. Now you can see that you were sleeping on the bench of a wagon, which somehow crashed through the wall of the chicken coop.

The current monarch, who only recently assumed the throne after their father’s death, fears the people might turn on them so they seek to cover up the heroes’ mysterious demise.

There are plates of food on tables, still warm. Clothes on a washing line are still damp. Only the doors into the mill are locked. As night falls, a fierce storm begins to build, and from the mill the saws can be heard rasping back and forth, though they don’t sound quite right…",

    "Small dolls sit in a tree the players pass by. They are wearing crude clothes, and don sticks of specific lengths. Poor perception rolls feel anonymous sets of eyes gazing at you, while good perception rolls can discover them. These dolls, if ignored, will appear again in a different tree a few feet up, requiring lower rolls as they subtly make themselves more obvious. Upon the first investigation, you find that the dolls are poorly stitched together, with leaves still poking out of the burlap fabric, and expressionless faces with small stones as eyes. However, with each successive perception roll as the party walks away, the dolls become slightly more realistic. On additional rolls their rock-eyes appear to follow you (Mona Lisa style), their skin becomes taut and leathery, and their clothes become more realistic. Repeat as necessary, with the players unable to leave a small section of the forest (due to magical barriers, or because walking straight forward keeps leading them back to the same spots.) Eventually, all of the dolls should clearly resemble everyone in the party. It is important that the dolls never appear to move on their own, and in every way act as though an inanimate object would. They can be destroyed, ripped, held, carried, etc. There should also be at least 4 separate perception checks on the dolls IMO. It really draws the frustration out, and that is an expression of fear. The final perception check on the dolls will have the dolls be very hard to find, except by one person, who you can choose beforehand. No matter how well other party members roll, the person you choose will feel a tingling on the back of their neck, and turn around to find the dolls in a high branch. They are nearly perfect mimics of the party, and are standing around the doll that looks like the person who discovered them, whose doll has a thick piece of string around their neck. The person feels paralyzed as the can only just watch due to fear, as time slows around them. The doll-party gazes directly into the player characters real eyes, and gently… pushes. For extra effect, have a pencil ready to snap upon this moment. Sometimes the cheesy sound effect speaks volumes more than words. The party will usually react at this point, let them destroy the dolls. It’s cathartic. If you want to continue the fear though, every one in a while later on, let them see a flicker of movement out of the corner of their eyes. Bonus points if you pick a grunge or mistake to build this off of. Like if a cleric forgets to heal a fighter and the fighter calls, have one of them be the one that pushes the other off, as though the cleric purposely didn’t heal, or the fighter was trying to get revenge. If the party has a rogue, have their doll slip a stick in the back of the hanged on. There’s a ton of customization you can do, and if done well, you can seed a lot of discord between two player characters and build their relationship to be really dynamic. Happy Creepy Crawlies.",

    "A sweet glade, dappled with sunlight and shadows provide a relief from the previous heat and humidity. A gentle brook flows along one edge and gurgled merrily. Several fruit trees sit in the center and lay heavily with ripe fruits. Flowers fragrant the air and a gentle breeze cool the glen, sweetening the air and cooling the weary traveler. An old body hangs from a limb of the tree, but upon inspection it appears obvious they could have stood and not strangled.",

Upon inspection, the player discovers old, dried blood embedded in the bark and writing in a deep red color that says ‘Find me, help me’ (illusory script). As the party continues they see more trees of a similar nature, and eventually find a crazed gnome who is determined to eat party members in order to restore his youth.",
    "The path opens into a clearing. Near the center is a unicorn lying down on its side. It looks serene and peaceful. The clearing is bright and quiet. Almost silent but for distant birdsong. If the party approach they realize it is dying. Its throat is torn open by some powerful beast and the wound looks infected or poisoned. The edges of the clearing are creeping in, going brown or fungus laden and choked with weeds and branches, which seem to close in whenever no one is looking in that direction. The unicorn is probably (?) past any help the party can give but may last an hour. Left to its own devices, the clearing will close in maybe 20 minutes.",

    "The undergrowth is thick confining you to a narrow path. It switched sharply left then right…. to a dead end. Turning back it is a dead end that way. The only way forward is to hack through the lower branches and scrub. As the players do, the cut stems ooze blood. If burned instead the wet plants hiss and whistle as they burn sounding like tortured screams.",

    "It has been at least 24 hours since sunset and it has yet to come back up. What’s worse is that all the forest chatter from insects and wildlife has trickled nearly to a standstill save for one slow but consistent crunching that has been following at a distance for hours now. Are the stars even moving anymore?",
    "Early in the day the party passes underneath a suit of armor suspended in the trees, branches occupying the inside of the suit as if they had squeezed out the body that occupied it before. Branches sprout from the facemask wildly, limbs protrude from the leg and armholes, and the entire chest piece is nearly bursting from the volume of foliage it contains.",
    "Just when its time to make camp for the night yet again within the damp cold forest, the party comes across an old house sitting unoccupied in a small clearing. They seek comfort in the house, building a fire in the hearth and drinking some old booze left by previous tenants. Keeping good watch, they peer out the windows frequently. Maybe it’s just the old wine but are the trees…. getting closer?",
    "A few chickens are pecking at the dirt in the middle of the trail. When you come upon them, you spook them, and they trot off into the forest a few meters. They resume pecking; but little does anyone know that they’ve begun to peck seeds that have the effect of the enlarge spell. Treat an enlarged chicken as an allosaurus and let the fun begin.",
    "Glowing eyes stare out of a knothole in an old and gnarled tree. When the players notice it watching, the thing scampers deeper into the tree.

    "A little twig-and-twine doll is pinned to a branch up ahead. Another just like it can be seen just off the path, and another beyond that one. Even in the depths of the woods you’ll be protected so long as you follow them. Your safety once you arrive where they’re leading you is less guaranteed. A polite invitation has been extended. It won’t come again.",

    "The trees in this part of the forest are all wrong. They’re growing in neat rows; they sway though there is no wind. Strange fruits swell in their boughs. You’ve stumbled into an orchard. Were those stones you stepped over a ways back someone’s fence?",
    "A boar bursts out of the undergrowth; foaming spittle flecks its tusks. It charges, eyes bloodshot, but makes no move to defend itself. All its attacks seem half-hearted. What drove this beast to seek death so?",

    "A fire shines through the trunks a little ways from you. Around it are adventurers, like you, camping for the night. None of them speak the same languages as you. The forest has them spooked, paranoid. They’ll welcome familiar company at first, but any number of things you do could set them off.",
    "A pond in a clearing, clean and still. No animal drinks from it, no insects buzz above it. No monsters will approach here beyond the tree line. Is it safe for you to stay here?",
    "The forest path is narrow and overgrown. Looking down the tunnel-like trail gives you vertigo and puts you off balance. Shadows appear to move and you feel like you’re just going in circles.",
    "The forest itself seems to be against your presence. Roots seem to spring up to trip you and branches swat at you when moved out of the way. The canopy closes around you shutting out the sunlight.",
    "The players hear footsteps echoing theirs, slightly behind, but the path is empty. Anything they call out is repeated back with missing syllables, as if the voice is in pain.",
    "A child’s laughter is heard off of the path, along with a flicker of light, which keeps appearing further away if the party follows. It leads them to the body of an elven boy with an arrow in his back.",
    "One member of the party hears the creaking of the trees and sounds of the forest suddenly stop, then a voice right behind them whispers their name on a hoarse voice, but there is no one there. None of the others notice anything different.",
    "The players hear the sounds of cries and screams from soldiers and the guttural cries of a nightmarish creature echo through the forest. The last one goes quiet before they reach them. If they choose to search, they find scattered around the ground the weather-worn skeletal remains of 16 soldiers from a long-dead empire known for it’s brutal methods, some of which are found ripped apart apparently trying to flee.",
    "The players feel as though something is watching them, but can’t see anything in the darkness. If they move more than 30ft in any direction they hear rustling following, but no matter how much they search cannot find anything.",
    "A dead character from one of the character’s past stands amongst the trees, with the appearance and wounds they had when they died. Only one person can see them. The character doesn’t move, but silently watches the player. Any attacks go through them without causing damage. They dissolve into a smoke-like darkness after 1d6 minutes.",
    "The sound of whispering is heard behind a bush. When it is pulled back or someone moves behind it, the whispering stops abruptly and a darkened feather falls slowly to the ground.",
    "A group of little girls are tied to the trees just off of the path, crying quietly. If the party goes to rescue them, they fight being rescued and attempt to escape and retie themselves to the trees, warning that ‘the Grogleman’ will come for them and their families too if they return home.",
    "A group of giants sit motionless around a giant chessboard, eyes intent on the pieces. Closer examination reveals the three are corpses; fungi grow from their eyelids and out of their hair, and the bodies slump and collapse if touched.",
    "The ground on both sides of the trail seems odd; upon closer examination, it is absolutely swarming with termites, covering the whole ground like a wave. If the party steps off the trail, the insects scatter from the party’s feet, leaving strange, momentary footprints in the ground.",
    "Prayers cannot be uttered aloud in the forest; spells can be cast as normal, but any verbal component comes out as a rattling hiss.",
    "A thick fog hovers over the ground, reaching up about two feet (to the chests of any halflings in the party, to the knees of humans). Anyone putting their heads in the fog (bending down to pick something up, etc.) hears muffled screams and far-off voices begging for their lives.",
    "Each person awakes to find a large meat hook carefully placed along on their bedrolls over their stomachs.",
    "In the periphery of the party’s vision, the trees that they pass seem to take on the image of a grim army, marching next to the party. When faced directly, the trees seem rather normal. The whole forest smells like a battlefield.",
    "Every time anyone lights a fire in the forest, there is a sudden hissing and smoking from the ground for twenty feet around the sparks. Little red lines appear like veins in the earth before fading to blackness.",
    "A monkey in a Jester’s costume comes swinging through the trees, hooting and screeching. If the adventurers catch the monkey, they find a bloody knife stuck in its belt. The monkey stares at them all with a baleful expression.",
    "Crows are screaming at each other as the party enters the woods. Increasingly, the screams sound like words, demanding blood.",
    "The hedge on the side of the trail has strange burn marks in it, almost exactly in the shape of men.",
    "A fox with a bloodied and broken leg comes limping up the path to the party and will pass by it if it can. If anyone speaks to it, the fox changes form into an old druidic woman, who mumbles about the forest being unsalvageable.",
    "As the party walks into the forest, they are greeted by an adventuring group coming the opposite direction. They chat for a little bit, explaining they found the woods too dangerous and are making their way back to whatever town the party has just come from. A little farther into the woods, the party finds the corpses of the same adventuring group, gathered around the sputtering embers of a fire…",
    "A bucket has been nailed to a tree, with a crude sign saying ‘Donations’ hanging under it. The bucket is half-filled with fingers and toes in varying levels of freshness.",
    "A small, neat signboard reads, ‘Please remain on the path.’ The neatness is somewhat marred by the corpses strewn below the sign.",
    "Someone has sharpened the branches around the trail in the forest, so that the trail is surrounded by sharp points.",
    "The party finds themselves staring at a strange tableaux- the corpse of a squirrel is placed next to an acorn, followed by (in order) the corpse of a cat, a dog, a wolf, and a bear. Behind the bear are strange scuffmarks in the dirt, like there was another corpse behind it, this one in the shape of something human…",
    "As the party walks through the forest, a strange figure suddenly drops from the trees in front of them- upon inspection, it is an effigy in the rough shape of a man, made of wooden boughs and leaves. This happens twice more as they walk. The fourth time, the figure drops down again, but anyone going to clear it away finds that it is actually the corpse of a man this time, with branches lashed to his limbs and a grisly smile on his face…",
    "A cold mist creeps into the surrounding area, players who breathe it will be asked to make a roll (perception, nature, etc.) but they’re making a constitution save with whatever modifier from the false roll. Anyone who rolls above a set DC inhales the mist and is subject to strange illusions.",
    "A hanged man rests on a lone tree. His pockets lined with petty change and a note that appears to be an apology letter to his family.",
    "For an hour of travel there’s no sound other than the party.",
    "A section of the forest has been frosted over in what appears to be a permanent winter. The center appears to have an unnatural cave of rocks that don’t match anything of the surrounding geological features. Inside features a drop that appears to be without end.",
    "A small portal opens up about 15 ft. above the party, expelling a blood lusted demon to the ground below. It bounces, stunned momentarily before it acquires a new target.",
    "A large head-sized knot in a tree resembles a human face. Wait! The eyes are real: wide, staring, terrified eyes! They look at you as you approach, flicking to each person that talks. But they cannot blink (so cannot communicate in that way), but constantly weep a watery sap.",
    "A large open area. The dirt seems fresher than the rest, no grass growing on the surface. The trees around the edge of the grove are burnt. In the middle sits (1d4) huge skulls, each at least 5 times the height of an average human. These skulls have gashes and claw marks in them, as well as huge spiraling or pointed horns. Scratched into the largest one is ‘entrance’ in infernal. If the player puts their ear to the ground and listens, they can faintly hear a low rumble that unnerves them to their very core and they don’t know why. Digging downwards could potentially reveal a connection between the material plain and one of the evil-aligned outer plains.",
    "The first character to awaken sees a grotesquely exaggerated face hovering inches from their own, glowing weakly with an internal light. An ear-to-ear grin splits the face, revealing a maw with three rows of serrated teeth. When the character blinks, the face disappears. It never appears again.",
    "The party comes across perfectly circle clearing. It’s barren waste, nothing ever grows there. Any flora the party might bring with them instantly wilts as it crosses the border. No animal, even as faithful as ranger’s companions, can be forced to cross into that circle. If the party decides to spend a night there, they will wake up outside the circle, with all their things scattered across the outer rim of the clearing. If they do it on the night of winter solstice, they will wake up in Avernus instead.",
    "The trees suddenly grow until the sun is blocked out and a magical darkness is cast from somewhere, and whenever the players talk, they hear their words repeated to them in their voice, but can’t tell where it’s coming from.",
    "The players slowly realize that they are on a loop in the forest. Every night they make camp, then wake up with supplies returned and make the exact same journey again. The players must find the source of this curse and free themselves.",
    "While the party makes camp, someone notices that there is an additional person around the fire. How did no one notice? Why does it smell like rotten meat? And why is it looking at the barbarian like that?",
    "In a less dense part of the forest, where moonlight pours through, the party witnesses a strange hulking creature (Mothman) perched on a tall tree. Its giant red eyes watch the party for a moment, before the creature flies away. The party sees the creature a few more times before coming to a large bridge built over a dangerous river. The creature appears one more time over head, just as the bridge collapses.",
    "After camping in the woods the party awakens to find the trees around them whipping and lashing as if buffeted by strong winds, though the party feels not even a faint breeze. Upon closer inspection, the party notices in mounting horror that the shadows cast by the trees are in the shape of human beings writhing in silent agony.",
    "The party comes across a 50ft circle of pitch-black darkness, with no logical reason as to its existence. Any players that cannot see when in such conditions hear whispers and chattering while in this area, and take 1d6 slashing damage for every round spent there. Any players that can see in such conditions (ex. darkvision) will not suffer any of these effects, and will see that nothing is attacking the others, but rather the wounds are manifesting onto them.",
    "You see corpses pinned to the sharpened boughs and branches of the tress around you, wood puncturing through their throats and sternums. The mottled moonlight filtering through the slowly swaying leaves gives them an eerie sense of motion. A sudden scampering and swish of branches punches through the soft rustling of the trees. Wherever you turn, the sound seems to be coming from behind you, getting closer and closer till you feel a hot, wet breath on the back of your neck. You swing around to confront the horror and see nothing but the corpses in the canopy, leering down at you like demonic piñatas.",
    "The party stumbles upon a clearing, with a post stamped into the ground. A message scrawled in Primordial reads about a treasure found in the hidden home of squirrels. With a few investigation checks, the party finds an odd tree. Around the back of the tree is a poorly hidden, though hidden, door. The door has no lock on it, but is not open; it has a feeling as though it is stuck. It can be forced open, or pried open, or cut open with fairly decent resistance. Inside is a staircase leading downward, lit by candles embedded in the tree that don’t seem like they’re burning the tree, though they are quite bright. After a 5-minute descent, the staircase ends in what appears to be a basement. The ceilings drip, and the room is damp and warm. (You can also narrate that the stairs are slippery, and have your players roll athletics not to slip). A decent perception roll can see that the floor and ceiling leak the warm water, without much of a source, while a really good perception check will notice that the color of the environment has become darker, and has a reddish tinge. Otherwise, there appears to be a library or study (whichever is easier for you to narrate.) There are no loose papers or pens and all of the books appear to be locked up, so that they cannot be taken out. A chest in the back can be found, a hair too conspicuously. Upon opening it, there is nothing inside but a pit, that smells of vomit and acid. With that, the room begins to shrink, slowly. The party should discover that they’re in the mouth of a giant mimic, who is swallowing them. Upon escaping, the entire tree uproots itself, spits and snarls at the players, and runs away. Best described if you can drop hints about descending the gullet of a beast, such as a hot draft, or distant gurgling.",
    "The party makes camp, and partway through the night, someone on watch starts to get an off feeling. Depending on perception rolls, they may or may not see the eyes watching from up in the trees, though they disappear just after being noticed. Additionally, they may hear the sound of leathery wings gliding through the air above them. Finally, after their defenses being lightly probed/tested, a creature attacks. (IIRC)I used a giant flying chupacabra from PF, but whatever works for you. The creature goes down relatively easily, but as it is struck down, it lets out a piercing scream. As quiet settles, the party hears answering cries from deeper in the woods."

    "A red tide laps at the shore. It’s infested with vampiric, symbiotic algae. A gaggle of infested people (evident by their crimson eyes and veins) are bathing in the stuff. They try to ply you with drugs and good company to offer up some blood (any sort will do), and become increasingly agitated if you do not. Their preferred mode of attack is to spike the dose of whatever they can get you to take with a sedative and drain you while you’re passed out.",
    "A sea turtle nesting site. You’ve arrived at just the right time to see the mass hatching. Predators will be gathering soon to pick off the baby turtles before they reach the water. Maybe you’ll be joining them.",

    "A resplendent coconut palm held sacred by local people. They know, but don’t speak openly of, a ritual by which you can remove an evil presence from someone’s mind (possession, madness, domination, enchantment, etc.) by trepanning them, drilling to the core of a coconut from the sacred palm, and placing the holes together to draw the evil presence from their head and into the coconut. Trees grown from coconuts used in the ritual are twisted things, bearing the mark of the evil they contained.",

If interrupted before then the monk will be incomprehensibly salty.",

    "A fish-man flags you down, says they were supposed to meet with a representative from a nearby village to discuss trade agreements, tribute, and breeding rights. As that representative is late, the fish-man explains, you will have to do. Some time in to the negotiation (or fighting, or whatever else) the representative will arrive and react to you based on how you’ve argued for the village’s interests.",
    "You glimpse a howling whirlpool and waltzing waterspouts a long way from the shore. The visible surface signs of the weapons of an underwater war.",
    "While walking along on the sand, you suddenly look down and see a turtle crawling toward you. You reach down and flip it over onto its back. The turtle lies there, its belly baking in the hot sun, beating its flippers, trying to turn itself over, but it cannot do so without your help. You are not helping. Why?"

In the little town of &amp;amp;lt;im bad at names&amp;amp;gt; they say that the moon does this when someone, somewhere, finds true love. During these days, tables are set out in the streets and people ask others to join them on dates, platonic and romantic, underneath the golden moonlight (similar to real world valentines dates).",
    "The Barstool Burning – After an incident where a mimic disguised as a barstool bit off a chunk of a poor patron’s bum, the tavern’s inebriated clientele burned all its barstools in the street. An afternoon of drinking and building street bonfires made of barstools and other flammables has since become an annual holiday that has spread to all the taverns in the city.

    "Monster Parade – Once a year, all the cities in region hold a parade where all the participants wear elaborate monster costumes. Larger cities may employ magicians for special effects and have multistory beasts mounted on wheeled carts with movable parts and participants riding inside. The final attraction in the parade is the “holy paladin” with an elaborate armor outfit and costume weapons who is driving the “monsters” away. The role of the paladin is chosen by popularity contest or some other method, and is almost never an actual paladin. The parade celebrates a plot to deter a foreign attack by making it appear that terrifying monsters had already overrun the streets, yet they were easily defeated and driven off by guards.",
    "The Bath and Swim – This “festival” originated in a region with intermittent vampire problems. When another drained person is found, every man, woman, and child in the territory are ordered to assemble and wade across a shallow river. Immobile people are carried and then submerged. A census is then taken, and anyone who didn’t show up or refused (even visitors) is captured and dunked. Bored youths waiting for the trials to end soon started a now traditional swimming contest in the deeper part of the river. Thanks to a pair of enterprising visiting bards, a recurring comedy act developed. Two bards playing an oblivious guard and a vampire sit in a single large wooden bath and deliver “Straight Man and Wise Guy” skits. The comedy act has an informative end: it addresses vampire powers and weaknesses, and cautions against explicitly inviting anyone into your home, or your bath.",
    "Masquerade ball – An event for the upper classes and nobility. Participants ballroom dance while wear highly concealing masks and costumes. Because everyone’s identities are ostensibly hidden, participants are expected to cut loose. Statements challenging authority, outrageous clothing, lascivious dancing, public displays of affection, impoliteness, crude jokes, and open gossip is also permitted. Many champions of silenced and oppressed factions voiced their first manifestos here. The masquerade ball is a can’t-miss for anyone investigating aristocratic allegiances and doings, social climbers seeking courtly influence, and underworld rogues looking for high level protection and buyers.",
    "Catacomb Carnival – Once per year in the great cities the citizens head to the catacombs to celebrate another year alive and honor the dead interred in them by properly cleaning and arranging the bones of those that have been in the catacombs for a year into elaborate structures and designs. Any bones that are damaged in any way are burned in a great pyre in the city square and the ashes are used in the mortar of the bone sculptures below. They also leave offerings to the beetles and rats that do the job of stripping the bodies down to the bone. After the catacombs have been cleaned and the years previous dead have been attended to there is a day and night of celebration where revelers light the catacombs and tunnels and celebrate in procession above and below the streets wearing masks of beetles, rats, and skeletons to ward off any dark spirits and denizens that might also haunt the dark recesses below the city.",
    "The Minstrel Masquerade – A yearly festival wherein bards gather from every kingdom to enjoy one another’s company. Every bard seeks an invitation to such a jovial event, but only a few will be deemed worthy of winning a “Bardy.” The masquerade’s origin stems from the tragedy of Gerrick the Mad. Gerrick was a loyal jester, a bard of Lore, whom kept his sleepless king laughing for 3 months straight. Unfortunately Gerrick was only a man, a simple bard, and when the king finally gave word for him to stop jesting, he fell to the ground, stone dead. This festival exists to honor Gerrick and other bards alike for their insatiable desire to be the best artistic minds in their kingdoms, and the horrid sacrifice Gerrick made for the price of his King’s smile.",

You see, each year the salmon spawn, die, then float to shore causing a special type of psychedelic river mushroom to form on their carcasses (after they rot for approximately a year). These mushrooms are collected and shared amongst the Firbolg community as a right of passage.",
    "Winter’s Ritual Day – To prepare the day before, a branch of the sacred tree is cut and carved into a bowl, in it, runes are scribed asking for what you want come Spring and the next year; fortune, fertility or good health and inside is placed a special candle. After midnight, the candle is lit by a special bonfire created by the temple. A special ceremony is held at midday, where the priest incants a ritual spell ceremony, asking that the city be warded from the Spirit of Winter till next year. After this ceremony, which lasts 5 hours, the people drink ale and sup broth from their bowl cup (candle still lit hopefully), until midnight when they blow out the candle. If your candle goes out beforehand, terrible luck will befall you in the coming year.",
    "Day of Mending – A celebration to better one’s community and strenghten the bonds between townsfolk, this holiday is a day when tailors, crafters, smithies and similar trades set aside their work for a day offer their services for free on small projects for members of their community. As the holiday has grown, it has become a tradition for others to offer their goods and services to the community as well: bakers give away small food stuffs, taverns offer drinks on the house (one per customer!), and musicians and artisans flaunt their talents to all. Many enjoy the holiday as an opportunity to bond with their neighbors and community, while the more savvy use it as an opportunity for self promotion. The primary tenet of the Day of Mending is that old grudges and quarrels are set aside, if only for the day, and folk put the community ahead of the individual before the old business resumes on the following day.",
    "The Lovers’ Return – One night each year, it is said that the spirits of a young man and woman return to roam the town where they died, looking for each other. Old tales tell of the young lovers kept apart, until one committed suicide from grief, only to be shortly followed into death by their partner. Now, the oldest townsfolk whisper of seeing the crimson specter of half-seen figures, sometimes a young man, sometimes a young woman, roaming the town on the night of the Lovers’ Return, rapping lightly on the doors of homes to be let inside to search for their lost love. The townsfolk believe that hanging certain totems around their entryways will keep the lovers from coming to their doors, but even so, every few years a young man or a young woman goes missing on the Lover’s Return, presumably taken away by one of the specters mistaking them for their lost partner.",
    "Winter’s Offering – An old holiday, mostly celebrated by rural farming communities, it serves as both a celebration to venerate the old gods as well as preparing the villages for the winter to come. After the fall harvest, each household is granted a number of bushels of the food grown, while a large portion of it is prepared and sealed in unadorned clay urns to be buried in the ground and kept in reserve for the cold, hungry months of winter. As well, the villagers bury the bodies of their young at this time: the stillborn and the infants who passed in the previous year, their bodies prepared and buried in urns painted black, offerings to the old gods. The old midwives of such communities often keep unruly children in line with tales of how the cries and tears caused by misbehaving children echo into the ground and cause the blackened urns to crack, prompting their buried occupants to crawl their way out to the surface and drag away bad little boys and girls.",
    "Festival of the Sashes – to commemorate the purge of a despotic royal lineage centuries ago, when the ruling family was chased out of town by the commoners, their clothing stripped of their bodies as they ran through the streets. Groups and families prepare mannequins adorned with colorful sashes, each trying to make theirs the most elaborate and festive. The mannequins are then hoisted on poles and carried through the city. The groups race from Royal Plaza to the city gates. People line the streets and try to grab and tear handfuls of the sashes and ornamentation off as the mannequins pass. The atmosphere is very festive with public drunkenness and groups of young people chasing after the mannequins.",
    "Week of Rest – Neighbors take turns cooking meals for each other. Based on when a plague swept through the town and some got better while others got sick.",
    "Monument Race Day – It is said that when a near by volcano erupted destroying the old town, after evacuating their families many of the villagers returned to move the stone monument from the old town center to the new town’s location. In honor of this deed, every year on the anniversary of the eruption, the townspeople form teams that carry replica monuments in a race from the site of the old village to the monuments’s current location. Afterwards the town celebrates by having lava soup (a spicy red tomato based soup), with monument shaped bread rolls.",
    "Lamentations of the Cinders – a somber day of reflection on the anniversary of the Great Fire that killed thousands. At third bell after noon, which is when the fire began, people begin silently filing from their homes. Everyone covers their faces with soot and ash. Particularly devout people or older folk who lost everything in the fire may go completely naked and cover their whole body in soot. Citizens keep their faces downcast as they slowly walk a circuit around the neighborhoods that were most affected. A bell tolls every minute for the lives that were lost. At sundown everyone quietly returns home. Recently people have begun to include a great feast of preserved foods, like jerky, salted fish, and dried fruit afterwards.",
    "Last Tidings – It is said there once was a witchy lass who fell in love with a sailor. He went to sea and for twentyfive years she would wait for him at the sea cliff until the last tide went out at dusk. On the final night of her vigil on the last outgoing tide of the year she received word that her lover had perished. She cursed and vowed to the heavens that nobody would ever have to suffer and wait as long as she did for closure. She performed some unknown ritual and ever since that night, on the last out going tide of the last day of the year, anybody who whispers the name of a loved one on the seaside cliff will either hear the name returned meaning they were still alive or hear the cry of an albatross and know them perished. Two night long festivals have arisen one mourning the other joyous as lovers learn the truth. It is no coincidence that many of the single participants find comfort and more in each other’s company.",
    "Wall of Melons – A hundred years ago the city was under siege. The invaders climbed a wall to get inside only to be rebuffed by peasants who tore down their own homes to toss rocks down on the climbers. The day is celebrated by a committee selecting a portion of wall up witch a the town’s young men try to clamber. At top are an equal bumber of lasses armed with melons both ripe and rotten. It isbl traditional for the first climber up to ask for and be given the hand in marriage of his choice. The climbers are protected by feather fall spells and blanket carrying elders.",
    "Sweet Night – The orchids of fruit trees in the town’s fields are pollinated by bats from a local cave. This wasn’t known until a hundred years ago when a vampire ravaged the country side. It was tracked back to the cave and burned out, scattering the bats as well. The next years harvests were bad until a traveling holy man told the villagers they must lure the vats back. This was done by pouring syrup and other sweets out on a long path from orchards to cave. It worked and has become an annual event to remind and thank the bats. The sweets used have become candies for children and alcohol for adults. It starts with a barnfire at dusk and culminates in a long hike to the cave. Dancing and costume wearing is common as well as many bat theme toys and souvenirs.",
    "War of the Monsters – An Olympic sports like event with many different athletic competitions and games. The main event is a destruction derby style event where groups make “monster wagons”. Essentially people driven/powered wagons/carts that are made to look like monsters of the world (dragons, dire animals, beholders, etc). The goal is just to disable the opponents wagons, not hurt the drivers. Last monster wagon still able to roll wins. History harkens back to a day many many years, when several large wild monsters wandered into town at the same time. They ended up fighting each other rather then attacking the people, in a territorial dispute. This gave the civilians time to evacuate and adventurers time to gain control of the situation. Contradictory stories developed how one monster (it’s always a different one, since no one agrees which it was) was actually there to save the City from the other monsters. As several monsters actually escaped, this “hero” monster is said to still be out there guarding the city. People in the city are split into groups by what monster they believe is their guardian.",
    "Day of stillness – No-one goes outside or opens doors for 3 days. Very worrying to newcomers to the huge city. It is surreal to see a giant city completely still and silent. Almost no lights and no answers. In remembrance in how they barely escaped the plague by not greeting any infected during those trying times.",
    "Day of the Hawk – Adepts at the shortbow and longbow compete in a test of skill and accuracy (ex. piercing a thrown copper penny-sized item in the center), hitting fast moving targets from horseback. Gnome artificers, smiths, and other weapons craftsmen travel to the city from far and wide to tout their new inventions and wares. The festival began when the city was a small village and those who came of age had to prove their proficiency with the weapon as part of demonstrating their skills in order to successfully hunt and defend the community.",
    "The Day of Ribbons – An annual occasion where beautiful ribbons are tied to posts all over town. When asked why, people only give a somber look. Nobody speaks about it, giving the impression that it’s disrespectful and insulting to do so.",
    "The Night of Burning – In memory of the defeat of an ancient black dragon that had kept them in slavery, this town has an annual tradition where they kill, cook, and eat a juvenile black dragon.",
    "Orctoberfest – A yearly weeklong celebration commemorating the defeat of a massive army of orcs that had once besieged the city. Lots of drinking of fermented beverages, dancing, and general public revelry.",
    "Market’s Day – A day of great deals and bargains from merchants and vendors. It marks the beginning of the new market year and celebrates when the open trading and selling of dwarven and elvish wares to humans was legalized throughout the land.",
    "Candlenights – A night when the entire city holds a candlelight vigil until the dead of night, and then exchanging gifts and celebrating with a feast. Groups of families and neighbors stand around the city in patches, while holding their candles up high. This commemorates the time when a group of adventurers killed a nest of gold dragons, relieving many of the farmers of the fear of being killed and their crops burned. The adventurers brought back the dragon’s hoard to share with the town, but because of a raging blizzard, had to be guided in by groupings of torches.",
    "Day of Snakes – a day literally celebrating the existence of snakes. Vendors sell all kinds of snake-related items, restaurants serve dishes with a bit of snake flair added on, and people release their pet snakes all around town. This goes far back to when there was a large rat pestilence in the town, and it looked like it would never get better until a random snake merchant came to town and offered to begin breeding snakes for them in order to control the population. Disease rates fell, overall cleanliness increased, and the town felt better overall after the rats were driven down to a dwindle.",
    "Propitiation of the Twins – around twenty years ago a pair of shooting stars appeared in the night sky. Soothsayers and astrologers predicted that this would usher in a new age of prosperity. People began leaving offerings in public squares to entice “the Twins” to bless their household. Now, every year on the anniversary, people have continued the tradition by lighting two candles and leaving a small bread cake in a public area at dusk.",
    "Boulder Pushing Day – On this day every year, the town splits into 2 teams (east and west). Using the whole town as a playing field, they attempt to push a boulder sized ball (many years ago they realized that a real boulder caused too much damage to the town)towards the opposite side of town. The winning team must push the ball into the outskirts of the town on the opposing side. It’s a friendly competition akin to a high school sports rivalry. Those who cheat or intentionally hurt others are looked down upon by their peers. The town sits in a u shaped valley that they say the gods carved out by rolling a marble on flat land.",
    "The day of Ashes – more of a ritual than a actual holiday. At this specific day of the year, the towns women get dressed in white and their faces are covered behind a veil. They roam the streets in packs singing and dancing, while the men, all dressed in black, try to coerce the women into having intercourse. Women are treated like goddesses, gifts are given to them and they have free choice of taking or refusing a partner. Each woman has a pot filled with ashes with her. After they have found and bedded their man of choice, they empty their pot onto his clothes, so the other women know not to touch them. This tradition comes from ancient times, when after a volcanic eruption the lands were covered with ashes and many people were killed by the initial eruption or starved to death in the aftermath of the event. To ensure the survival of the ancient tribes in this region, the council of all tribes instated the law of reproduction. What the town celebrates today is the day for the gods and the women, who ensure the succession of their lineage.",
    "Festival of the Drink – Long long ago, a small group of dwarfs set out into the wilderness to establish a new outpost for the glory of their empire. When they finally settled down, they were quickly able to establish a secure outpost with plenty of food, but soon they realized they were missing one of the most important supplies of all. Alcohol. Without this necessity, order soon began unraveling in the fledgling outpost, until the lone brewer was forced to improvised. Facing no other choice, she ordered everybody to gather as much of any kind of fruit that they could find. Once the gathering was complete, she worked tirelessly for a week straight to make alcohol out of anything the other dwarfs had brought, churning out such strange brews such as cherry wine and plum cider. At the end of this massive burst of brewing brilliance, the anxiously waiting dwarfs were finally rewarded with the finest tasting drink they had ever tasted in their life. In remembrance, the now flourishing Dwarven outpost celebrates this event in it’s history by holding a festival every year where brewers compete to create the best brew possible from the local fruit chosen for that year.",
    "The Sun God Observation Day – On this day all the village observers the sun god. I.e. stare at the sun as long as possible. The people at the village do this because an old witch told them that it would prevent them from seeing the destruction of the village. Since everyone is mostly blind her prophecy seems to have come true.",
    "Wishmore Night – The city holds a festival at the docks, all walks of life are included and encouraged to mingle with each other. Everyone, either individually or in groups create floating wreaths in whatever way they want to present it. At midnight when the water is still, the leader of the city will wade out into the water and release their wreath first, as an offering to the gods. Everyone in turn will release theirs following the leadership, before returning to the festivities which will often go long into the next night. This celebration is to thank the gods for a bountiful year, or even a year of character building (in case of hard times). It is to mourn those lost in the Shipping routes and to pray for the safe return of others. If the water isn’t disturbed except for the wreaths, it is fabled to be a year of easy storms for the sailors. It is also of note that these wreaths never ever turn up anywhere else in the world. They disappear completely.",
    "Celebration of Destruction – The Nine Hells love the awakening of the tarrasque so much that they make it a festivity. The celebration comprises of feasting upon whatever the titan destroyed and watching it as it rampages through entire cities, leaving nothing but rubble and dead life of all varieties in its wake. After the gargantuan beast falls asleep once again, all of devil kind praise the strength and ferocity of the powerful tarrasque.",
    "Ale Day – A dwarven celebration that simply commemorates the invention of their favorite drink. It quickly spread to many other humanoid peoples. Dwarves and satyrs love it the most.",
    "Owlbear Memorial Day – Elven cities that use owlbears as defense use this day to give thanks to the beasts that have protected their land for decades, sometimes centuries. The whole town offers food of all kinds for the creatures below. It’s very easy to argue that the owlbears enjoy this day more than the elves above ever could.",
    "Festival of Life – A celebration of the Upper Planes where the denizens of the heavens celebrate the good in every creature of the Material Plane. Commonly occurs when large amounts of good, neutral, or unaligned creatures are born. This involves animals and humanoids alike. A huge feast is held with some of the most delicious food in existence.",
    "Day of the Arts – An elven celebration where every form of art is honored. For months before this day, humanoids all across the Material Plane prepare songs, plays, dances, paintings, sculptures, and many other forms of art. A favorite day for many satyrs, with many placing it right behind Ale Day in their lists. Bards of many peoples are particularly fond of this festival. Silver dragons also love to celebrate alongside the humanoids that have arrived.",
    "Beholder Day – A holiday invented by beholders to celebrate themselves. They give themselves presents, and demand that their servants get them presents or they die. If a cult has decided to worship the floating aberration, the beholder will only have to remind its worshipers once and it has a myriad of presents coming its way. Unlike normal holidays that occur annually, Beholder Day happens once every week.",
    "Cliffton Day – Cliffton was a local legend who long ago had defeated a demon water elemental which came upon the small fishing village of Mistwood. They celebrate his triumph every year with contests which correlate to what traits he was known for. Whoever wins any of the contests then participates in a final contest, the winner of which is given the title of “Aspect of Cliffton,” and is then invited to participate in a ceremonial recreation of the famous battle. They are given a costume and Cliffton’s old ax and told to strike down an effigy – a standing effigy of the demon is already in center of town, but underneath the rags which make up the costume is a bound man, the village drunk, being put to death without knowledge of the adventurers. Maybe now that the adventurer is close to the figure, they can hear strained breathing amidst the cheers and song of the villagers. If they refuse to complete the ceremony, the same water demon who attacked the town years ago rises from the nearby lake and threatens to destroy the town once again. As it turns out, the killing of a man in the ritually-prepared town square once a year is part of a ritual that keeps the demon at bay.",
    "The Betrothment Battle – Every year on the first weekend after the Summer solstice, the town plays host to a wrestling tournament and exhibition. Hand to hand fighters from across the realm come to the town to prove their mettle, and rings are prepared for non-tournament participants to settle small arguments that have built up over the year. Named for a famous fight in the town at the wedding of the Mayor’s son and one of the prominent merchant’s daughters that saw the merchant, the mayor and most of their families tear apart the public house, the tavern, and a stable in an hours long fight.",
    "The Wardens Gauntlet – In the spring the city’s best and brightest face each other in a series of physical and mental challenges. Some are complex rituals, puzzles and riddles testing mind and spirit. Others are tests of endurance, agility, and strength. Betting and boasts are a much enjoyed portion and the contests themselves are openly viewed by the public to cheer on their favorites. The top three are given the honorary title of Warden followed by celebration where the previous Wardens hand off the mantle to any new Wardens or retain their station from the previous year. These Wardens represent the common people in matters of ceremony and any concerns or grievances to the Crown and city councils until the next years contest. Being a warden is often the path to guild leaderships or council seats and even titles from the crown. The history behind the trials and celebrations is vaguely remembered from the time of city states when open warfare was avoided by settling issues between the Wardens of each city state. There was also a darker reason for the intricate rituals and ceremony. Now considered just a spiritual and mental exercise, they serve an unknown purpose strengthening ancient Runes and Spells against something truly horrific that is ever vigilant and hungry.",
    "Stabbing Day – Using fake daggers the populace honors the day a group of rouges saved the city from a dragon attack. It’s exactly what you think, expect red dye stains.",
    "Rom’Chuk – Local barbarian tribes meet together in an unfortunate city and hold a Dwarf tossing contest. Use of Gnomes with fake beards is extremely frowned upon.",
    "Siggi’s Birthday – A great shield maiden gave her life to save the city. Women can let anyone they are sweet on know by picking them up over their shoulders and hauling them off. Siggi wasn’t known for her subtlety. Rooms at the Inn are free in her honor.",
    "The Games – A week of festivities that include games of all types under the sun; from dexterity-tests like obstacle courses, to strength competitions such as log-tossing, and even an academia note to it, like a spellcaster’s competition. This week of fun was created some time ago when a tyrant ran the city with an iron fist. Once a year he would force his supplicants to participate in crazy games which usually ended in their death. Once he was overthrown, the citizens opted to keep the week of festivities, whilst removing the “death” part. It helped the community grow closer, keeping those with terrible ambitions out.",
    "The Pilgrimage – A day when every person in the city is expected to “carry their weight” and bring their greatest distress out in the open, so that their neighbors, friends and community may support them in earnest. Those who refuse to participate are exiled from the community until they complete a pilgrimage to the neighboring continent and bring back something that will actively make their community better; be it money, food, or magical wards. This is a practice from when the city was still just a fledgling town and every person needed to pull their own weight, and everyone relied on everyone else to support each other.",
    "Lottery Day – A crop fertility ritual where outsiders are encouraged to attend. Eventually someone is picked at sundown and stoned to death by the crowd. Do not take the raffle tickets they offer…but there are prizes afterwards.",
    "Day of the Horn – the ceremony draws in tieflings like moths to a flame. Almost hypnotized by the low droll of an ancient obsidian tiefling skull horn being played amongst the music. Dusk brings the climax of the festival where all the spirits of an ancient battle posses the revelers and show them an ancient battle where a contingent of tieflings rebelled against their fiend masters and joined with the townsfolk to drive the demons back to Hell. The leader selflessly gave her life to save her comrades and new friends by blowing a smoldering hole through the chests of no more than 15 fiends…leaving just her skull. “We Remember” is the mantra and afterwards the tieflings are thanked and cared for with the thought “We can be more than the sum of our parts”.",
    "Madel’s Star Day – A meteorite fell to form a crater where a town eventually sprang up. The 5 meter rock absorbs all hostile magic and steals any illusions. The soothing rhythmic glow is amazing to behold. Only a handful of elders have metal bracelets fashioned from the meteorite that allows them to cast spells in town. Only one new one is awarded every century. In town it allows for casting of spells, outside of town it has a chance to absorb a hostile one (even your own). The properties of the stone also royally mess with any Warforged that come into contact with it.",
    "Grey Snow Day – A volcanic instability in the area uncovered a ruined fiend city. Excavations uncovered ancient masks that the party goers wear. The volatile nature of the masks grant a limited form of fire manipulation after sun down. The party notices that a vague form of possession is slowly corrupting the crowd every year.",
    "Fomarath Day – Laurel and oak wreaths are adorned and offerings prepared for the four treefolk guardians in a nearby permanent druid grove. A group of Hill Giants were about to lay waste to a group of farmers when a druid and his party drove them off. The druid stayed behind for a year to make sure the spell would stick. The treefolk actually love the townsfolk and have attracted other peaceful sentient plants.",
    "Craghoof Moot – A nomadic band of centaurs and a nearby halfling settlement have a very intertwined history of one ancestor saving another or one group saving the other from invasion. The most noble thing a member could do is swear an oath to one another to ride together for a year and a day protecting the territory. The amount of high grade alcohol and mead available is mind boggling. Watching halflings in war paint and centaurs in straw hats and vests is quite hilarious.",
    "The Druid Chain festival – As a last ditch protection against incursions into this dimension three druids, twelve elementals, and three dragons can unite and merge for a primordial ritual called a Gaia Chain to drag whatever horror that threatens all existence into the maw of the planet itself trapping it within the molten core for all eternity. It kills all those involved and as such the three temple locations became holy places to all forms of life. It is the raw elemental fury and power of the first ones that saved the world are remembered in giant soul crystals that once a year show the images of these lost heroes.",
    "Broken Toy Day – Warforged holiday marking their Independence.",
    "The Anniversary of The Great Mayhem – Recalls the day tribe of barbarians, orcs, and goblins laid absolute waste to a city of necromancers, warlocks, and wizards.",
    "Eeling – every autumn as the eel population in the local reservoir grows too great, the Swanmay invite the local village to come and collect as many as they can stock for the year. While fresh eel is on the menu, the festival itself is a community occupation, jarring eels, processing oil from them and otherwise making sure that what they want will keep until next year. Large communal tables are set up in the town square and the locals gather early to get a place at the centre most tables where gossip and ale flow strongest.",
    "Digging High – At summer solstice the various dwarven families of the area come to The Kin Hole, where they will mine as one for the three days of the festival. The hole itself is barren of valuable minerals, but the myth that the families’ ancestors divined great wealth for all dwarven kind at its completion still exists. While much merriment is made by the dwarves, the presence of outsiders is an immediate dampener.",
    "Gluttony – though not a festival per se, the first two months of the year are always eagerly anticipated by the hobbi… the halflingses of Portree. The tradition of the wealthier houses organising lavish bashes during the time as a means of canvassing has replaced a very loose sense of meritocratic governance with a very enthusiastic intoxicracy.",
    "The Quiet – in the old days, the village of Pertiv was in a most precarious position. Early settlers had grouped to farm an area which they only later realised was threatened by orcs, owlbears and darker things from below. While everyone celebrates the heroes who saved the village all those years ago rambunctiously in Spring, in late autumn the people remember the early days of fear and salvation by drinking heavily together in silence. Any but the most necessary and cursory communication is looked down on, and there are those in the village old enough to remember those times from their childhood.",
    "Fyre – The burning of the Winter Witch. They say that the Winter Witch (who is the spirit of winter) is dull and dreary, but can be driven away with humor and merriment. Villagers celebrate by erecting bonfires and once the sun touches the horizon they are set alight. They drink mulled wine, play games in the snow and sing crude songs to drive the Winter Witch away.",
    "Grimm – Orcish first blood ritual. An orc is a child until they are blooded, among the more civilized tribes of orcs this takes place in a festival called Grimm. Those deemed worthy or are brazen enough to try form a Wog or raiding party then a suitable target is chosen usually small Kobold warren or goblin outpost. All participants must bring back a heart for Grummush (their god) and a head to prove their prowess.",
    "Spring Break Wizard Demolition Derby – A popular beachside town is inundated by hundreds to thousands of student and apprentice wizards from several large nearby schools out on holiday break. The wizards inevitably form carousing groups, get absolutely sloshed, and then try to show off their spells to intimidate rival schools, impress potential dates, or simply cause chaos. In order to keep the wizards out of town proper and redirect the damage, the town sets up beer gardens, bathrooms, dirt cheap “inns”, and other sacrificial establishments on the beach. The student wizards naturally make it their goal to destroy absolutely every temporary structure they can, culminating in a massive destruction derby on the final night. Meanwhile, the city residents cower and hope the dispatched army can keep them from invading and burning down the town, again.",
    "Spring Break Playwright Championship – A popular beachside town is inundated by hundreds to thousands of student and apprentice bards from several large nearby schools out on holiday break. The bards inevitably form carousing groups, get absolutely sloshed, and then try to outdo the acts of rival schools, impress potential dates, or simply make a name for themselves. In order capitalize on their creative output and increase tourism, the town builds temporary theaters on the beach. The student bards naturally make it their goal to claim the most audience. Students create original productions in several different categories, marching band, full orchestra, historical drama, tragic opera, comedy musical, dance, etc. and debut them head to head against rival groups from all the different schools. The one who captures the most audience wins. On the final night, all the student bards join together for an all night jam session. The city residents who aren’t spectating are out cold after over-drinking during productions. (Free alcohol is often used to bait audience members.)",
    "Spring Break Ascetic Training Festival – A popular mountain town is inundated by hundreds of student and apprentice monks who jogged hundreds of miles to sit under cold waterfalls made of fresh snowmelt. The monks tend to be fairly orderly since this location is a prime spot to focus one’s ki and discover new techniques. Some waterfalls have better reputations than others, so the student monks will challenge each other for superior meditation spots. The poor fasting students monks tend not to bring much revenue, but tourists who want to watch them fight do. The town constructs several “arenas” sculpted from natural materials with silenced stands so the monks are not disturbed in their combat or meditation. The town hosts a streetside festival with many booths on the final day with rich foods for the starving monks and tourists to enjoy. Some more enterprising monks also do demonstrations or offer basic self-defense classes to tourists.",
    "The Bathing – Held at the height of summer. A highly respected priest started this tradition many years ago for those who could not afford to enter the elitist bath-houses. Townspeople gather at the calmest part of a great river just outside of town and bath naked. Considered a family friendly event, those who attend forgo their qualms about nudity and know that all are equal in the eyes of the constantly moving water.",
    "Lock Day – A small town dug up a mountain 90 years ago to make room for a new city hall, but ended up finding a black safe with an unbreakable lock. It can’t be moved or destroyed by any means (even a disintegration spell). Every year, they have a big festival where people try to open the lock. Everyone expects them to fail, but it’s the fun in trying. They amp them up too; an announcer holler their praises…”weighing in a 220 pounds, the scourge of Neverwinter, the axe-wielding monster, [barbaian character name]. But there’s drinking, dancing, a ceremony from the town’s Cleric, trading, cookies and cakes for sale. It’s a wonderful good time. Then…one day…the safe opens by itself.",
    "Independence Day – celebrating independence from a former ruling nation. Tons of drinking and local food that other nations think you always eat, but you really don’t eat as much of it as they think.",
    "Celebration of Armistice – Once a year, the ambassadors of every major city in the neighboring continents bring gifts to all the smaller hamlets and towns around the land. Gifts include anything from supplemental food to last for a long winter, new technologies, mages looking to relocate and can lend a hand to smaller communities… This tradition goes back some centuries, long enough that even few elves remember the origins. Legend says that a great tyrant sought to control the lands around, and a massive war raged for a long time. Eventually the tyrant was assassinated from the inside of his court, and his officers extended an olive branch to the peoples around, before disappearing themselves.",
    "Festival of Limitless Water – A yearly celebration in town, where townsfolk race boats, swim, drink locally brew beer and feast on roasted fish. A reminder to appreciate the gifts the waters bring them, and to remember the year a storm tore through the town, destroying most of the crops and buildngs. The boat race is a recreation of the villagers urgent travel seeking aid.",
    "Leatah’s Warming – the town celebrates the anniversary of their religious rebith to the forest spirit Leatah, who accepted the hospitality of the town many years ago.

It turned out to be a hit, and the halflings have been heralded as heroes to their city from that point onward.",
    "Nymm – The Grand Cookoff – Contests of the best food and drink. It’s held in Gatherhold by the House Ghallanda. The roots here go back a very long time to when the local Patriarch would force his cooks to eat their dish in front of him, to ensure that it was not poisoned. Long after he died, the tradition was carried on, but without the terrible connotations.",
    "Lharvion – The Costumed Carnival – Everyone is in costume and there are costume games. From a rather scary time in the city when it was invaded by an outsider army, and everyone had to be as resourceful as they could with making disguises to fit with the plethora of monsters that the outsider’s army used.",
    "Barrakas – The Hide and Seek Fair – Games of hide and seek, scavenger hunts, treasure maps. Goes back a ways to a deadly cartel that used to torment the people of the city, demanding that they follow maps to find these “treasures” that usually lead to many people missing or dead.",

    "Aryth – The Great Headstrong Races, this is a time of personal speed races; foot races, climb races, mud tobogganing, etc. A festival honoring the legend of Aryth, who is known as the fastest creature to live.

    "Vult – The Rogues Escapade. A fair about getting into and out of trouble. Teams devise cunning traps that the other team must escape from, then they switch.

Attractions there include all kinds of ways to prepare cabbage, giant cabbages that have been hollowed out, cabbage stories, cabbage planting seminars.

This strange celebration goes far back to when the only thing that a nomadic tribe of people had left to eat was cabbage, and some people went insane because of it.",
    "Day of the Siren – Quite unnerving for a first time traveler to witness. About 1/3 of the city’s population will meet in the square every 3-4 hours during daylight, and only once after nightfall. They will scream, shriek, wail, shout, or otherwise make vocal noise at the highest possible volume. This came about as a defense from a siren who once lured too many of the city’s capable workers during a particularly hard summer. The shrieking was designed to scare off the siren as her song was sung, and after it was confirmed she had died, the city kept it up as a final insult to the dead fey.",
    "Founder’s Blessings – A day when the local clerics hold a vigil in the streets, doling out blessings or healing as needed. Anyone is welcome, but in order to receive such a gift, one must recite the names of the city’s founders.

    "Bride’s day – Commemorating the beginning of summer, all the new brides dance with the unmarried women, to imbue to them their own marital fortunes.

    "Anthem – the proud holiday of the city where a multitude of people gather drunkenly in the streets to sing bawdy songs loudly and obnoxiously. Anyone who asks them to keep quiet is met with a barrage of rotten fruits and/or vegetables. This comes from a long time of religious oppression brought by a cadre of evil paladins. The singing was the first act of rebellion, and the rotten fruits signify when the city folk began attacking to drive them out.",

Lots of fish due this way. Origins are iffy, but there’s a legend about a giant talking fish that came out of the river and asked for food from the elders of the city.",
    "Bargaining Day – A day when all villagers have a chance to ask their greater community to help them with something. The community can ask for something in return, or nothing at all. No guarantee of a request being honored, even with payment given. This dates back to when the town used to have an elder dragon living beneath it. They would plead with the dragon for help, and it would make requests of them, sometimes with a promise to honor their plea, but often ignoring them.",
    "The Rain Run – One the day of the first rain after the summer months, the entire town gathers on the outskirts and has a race. Anyone who finishes in the top ten are exempt from the strenuous labors that come with damming up the rivers, or strengthening the embankments around the city to prevent mudslides. This promotes a lean and fit community.",
    "Silence Peak – A day when no one in the city will utter a single word. All communications are done using basic sign language. Anyone who speaks is tied up in the middle of the town square for the remainder of the day. Going back to when a powerful and malevolent wizard ruled the region, using listening spells to seek out malcontents and squash rebellion before it began. Eventually people coordinated in silence, and he was over thrown."

The man and his wife served him and another traveler up food pulled from a wooden box in the kitchen and gave them a place to sleep. In the night, the goblin arose and grabbed the box, delighted to have found such a prize. To cover his escape, he lit the home on fire and ran into the night. Once he had passed out of reach of any pursuit, he opened up the box. Inside he found three crusts of bread. The woodsman and his wife had shared all but their very last food with him, and in return he had robbed them and burned their home. The goblin flung the box down, and then was sent reeling to the ground by a powerful blow. He looked up into the eyes of the other traveler, dressed in silver armor and holding a mace. The traveler, a cleric of a goddess of justice, had managed to put out the fire before it had done any real damage, and then had come after the goblin. Rather than kill him, he declared that the goblin would serve him for three years, one for every crust of bread in the box. Over the next three years, Three Crusts served as the cleric’s servant, then his squire and friend. Three Crusts took holy orders himself shortly after the three years ended, and is now a paladin.",
    "Gulzyat the Undying – This little cursed fellow is a horrible nuisance. He wears nothing but a ratty pelt from a Dire Badger with the upper half of the badger head worn like a helm and the ratty pelt acting as a cloak and an old rusty piece of full plate elbow joint as a codpiece. The badger is appropriate because once you kill Gulzyat he seems to tenaciously come back to life at the worst of times appearing out of no where to exact a bit of revenge for his death. He is just a normal goblin for the most part so Gulzyat is not so much a physical threat himself but more about the ill timing of his reappearance. Trying to sneak around the sleeping hill giant? Not so fast here comes that odd little goblin you thought you killed to make a racket and wake him up. Trying to lie your way past the city guard? Guess what, the little bastard speaks enough common to pop up and let them know what you are really about. Trying to impress a noble, hard to do when a goblin appears chanting your name and peeing on his plate of roast duck. Remove curse only works for one encounter where Gulzyat would have appeared and then he turns up again like a bad penny. A wish can rid you of Gulzyat sending him to pester someone else but the only other way is to trick some other poor sap into killing the little nob and getting someone else to take on Gulzyats ire that is currently directed at you.",

    "Gorscrik Bleeder- A gloom hunter who seeks vengeance against a powerful Hobgoblin warlord. Gorscrik became a goblin veteran the hard way, in the massed ranks of a barely-armed and untrained horde invading Human lands. Driven on by Hobgoblin masters and clambering over the mounds of their own dead, the wave of green swept over the north of the continent, sacking cities and overwhelming armies. The southland, fertile and lush, beckoned to the goblins. But the Hobgoblin leadership, led by High Chief Captain Druzz’defor, chose to turn the horde against the Dwarven fortress of Merget Mon-Moor. Gorscrik, who was sent as a scout, returned and reported that an attack would be madness. In response, Druzz’defor demoted him and assigned him to the first rank of footmen sent against the Fortress, referred to now by goblins as The Grinder. Facing veteran Dwarves in prepared defensive positions, the mighty green horde was butchered brutally and mercilessly. Gorscrik, by an odd turn of fate, survived the battle, lying senseless in the sea of his slaughtered comrades. After being washed into a side tunnel by a Dwarven Waste Disposal crew, he revived and learned to survive in the hazards of the Underdark. He returned to the topworld hungry for revenge and glory.",

Maybe he will give some magical items or enlighten the party with hints if he is treated very nicely?",
    "Hobbin of the Dirt – A loony, mud-soaked, and scratched up goblin that wanders the forests, believing herself to be a powerful druid capable of communing with the trees. Her only companion is a ferocious and blood-thirsty badger that Hobbin can happily calm with a long hug.

    "Fared the Gilded – As an old test subject for the secretive magus Jordroy, Fared was constantly exposed to strange magics, often for long periods of time. It was during one of Jordroy’s alchemical mishaps that Fared had he chance to escape his cage and run to freedom, although not before being doused in a variety of mysterious reagents. By the time Fared had a chance to rest and look himself over, the entire right side of his body from knee to ear had transformed into solid gold.

    "Glizbik, The Dawn Priest – Glizbik was once a feral goblin that preyed on local travelers with his tribe, simplistic in his fondness for violence and shiny things. One day, he and his tribe raided a lone priest traveling the road. The priest pleasantly divided what he was carrying among the confused hunting party, and gave his holy symbol to Glizbik. He winked at the goblin and told him that when the time came that he wanted something more than this life he led, all he had to do was grasp the necklace and believe. Before the old dwarf could say anything else, the rest of Glizbik’s tribe attacked and killed him in the hopes they could find anything he was holding out on. Glizbik spent the next few days in contemplation, watching his fellow goblins squabble over their petty loot and trinkets. He found himself believing that they could be better, and that he should be better too. With that belief, he clasped his amulet and heard the voice of Auphaela, The Breaking Dawn for the first time. The Goddess of the Rising Sun told him of a better way of life, and showed him visions of what that could look like, promising that she would show him the path if he would be willing to walk it. Filled with a flurry of emotions for which he had no names, he made a promise to Auphaela that the priest’s words were not spoken in vain, and that he would guide his people out of the dust and into a life of higher ideals and racial unity. He now travels the land with a small group of goblins who share his beliefs, seeking to fill more goblins with the guiding light of the Goddess of New Beginnings. He strives to embody her tenants of charity and respect in the hopes that he may one day be able to atone for the sins of his tribe, his people, and himself. Though he sometimes falls victim to the pettier urges of his race, he always manages to quickly recover and use his power as a cleric of Aupheala to make amends.",

    "Armor Ecdysis: The boss is wearing powerful heavy armor that takes damage instead of the boss, but makes the boss slow. As the armor is attacked, it breaks off and leaves the boss vulnerable, but the boss gets faster and more maneuverable as a consequence.

In this mode it can’t attack or move, however it takes 1/4 damage from all physical attacks, has a 1 in 6 chance to reflect all damge back to the attacker and heals for Xd4 points (where X is the number of players it faces) at the start of its turn. The defensive mode lasts until it loses enough hp (again, up to the DM) or it recovers back to full health. It then returns to attack mode. The golem had five stages, each denoted by it losing a peice of armour after each defensive stage was ended by it taking damage rather than healing.

For example, for one round they may be a horde of smaller, weaker creatures, and on the next round they may fuse together to become a larger and stronger creature. The DM has a number of stat blocks prepared for creatures this boss can form, each of which has a minimum HP requirement to form. To make things more interesting, there may be stores of additional mass hidden around the battlefield, which the boss will attempt to reach to regenerate hit points and mass. If they want to keep the boss down, the players will have to stop any part of the boss from reaching those stores of HP.",

    "Whilst the party is adventuring at sea, their ship is beset by a dragon turtle of legend named Kiirn. An intelligent and greedy sonofabitch, Kiirn sinks ships for their cargo which he then takes to his nest in a cove on a nearby island. The first stage of the fight takes place in the sea with players on a ship, which Kiirn is attempting to sink. The captain of the ship deems la d the only safe haven and heads for the nearest landmass, Kiirn’s island. Along the way Kiirn may become damaged enough to retreat, but the Captain insists on landing and repairing the damage. Otherwise, the ship becomes damaged enough and sets off on a crash course for the beach. The second stage of the fight is a scramble up the beach as an angered Kiirn attempts to kill the party and sailors. Players may stand and fight, attempt to rescue the sailors or flee. Kiirn is less concerned with the cargo than the people at this point. The third stage follows the retreat up the beach, a chase through the rainforest on the island. The players may chase Kiirn to finish him off as he leads them to his cove, or Kiirn may chase the players, angered by their defiance and the damage they’ve done, or perhaps angered that they escaped him at the beach. The fourth stage is a fight in a large cave that leads to the cove. This is the point at which players and Kiirn alike are likely be exhausted and close to death. FINISH HIM. At each stage, Kiirn has a different objective which can vary based on the player’s actions. You can also spice it up with Kiirn having something akin to lair actions in each of the stages as well as environmental opportunities.",

Each turn, the Necro dancer summons ‘backup dancer’ skeletons, or something that would be comparatively weak for the party’s level. This goes on until the song ends, at which point a giant disco ball is dropped from the ceiling with the intent to crush the players, taking advantage of the disadvantage dex throws and lowered movement. After that, the dancers stop being summoned, the zone of irresistible dance does not get cast again, and the Necro-dancer is left all alone.

    "A towering, ominous obelisk made of steel is guarded by 3-6 Animated Armors, 3-6 Flying Swords, and 1-3 Helmed Horrors. The obelisk is covered in glowing arcane sigils and scribbles that shine brighter when the player’s step forward to confront it, at which point the assorted defenders move to attack. The obelisk manifests a eye-like sigil which moves around its surface each turn to channel a beam that repairs and reanimates fallen defenders. This beam causes the target to regain 3d8 hit points as the components are magically regrown and imbued once more with magical energy, and is fired one time on each of the obelisk’s turns. Any destroyed constructs hit with the beam come back to life at 0 hit points and regain the amount rolled for the beam, though they cannot take their turn until the following round. To beat the obelisk boss, the invaders may attempt to attack a construct targeted by the eye beam while the ray is being channeled, which causes the amount of damage dealt to it to also go through to the arcane entity within the obelisk. The boss also takes 10 damage every time one of the arcane sigils or a significant part of a particular scribble is erased or damaged in some way, whether the marks are gashed deeply with a blade or blotted out with a destructive spell. The arcane entity within the obelisk has a total of 80 hit points, while the obelisk and the magical markings on it have an AC of 15. Destroying the obelisk entity makes it dissipate into the surrounding area without a trace, causing the arcane markings to go dark and all the constructs to fall apart, thereby ending the boss fight.",
    "Some amorphous creature that is under the permanent effect of a mirror image spell that refreshes after all images are dispersed (which could be flavored as overlapping images of the same figure, or many different figures, like nightmares, occupying the same space).

It has an obscene amount of health and CON and cannot take damage from an attack that does less than 10 damage. A called attack to the head that does more than 30 damage or a grapple check followed by a DC 15 STR check will remove the armor’s helm from its shoulders, causing it to collapse. An arcana check will reveal that the armor is powered by a small gem on the inside of its forehead. A DC 19 slight of hand can remove the gem.",
    "An artificer that uses a set pool of arcane energy (let’s say 100 mana) to power his magical armor and wand. He uses various spells, each of which take away mana. His magical armor prevents damage to himself at the cost of mana.

The Flesh Golem’s skin has seen a number of brutal battles, and has caused it to become torn which a poor slave has had to stitch up repeatedly after each battle. The Golem often bleeds from the stitches in combat ex-specially when the beast takes fire damage causing the creature to take disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn. The creature often leaves out a loud roar when burned by any source of fire damage.

The only way to damage it is by using spells/ bombs that affect both spaces at once, stealth attack it, or coordinate multiple attacks, so there are players waiting to strike as the cyclops teleports. Approximate CR is 7, one more than a normal cyclops, even though it’s stats are the same.",
    "A gargoyle with a big scratch on it’s neck. The gargoyle’s skin is tough rock, making it immune to all but psychic damage, unless the damage is applied to the tissue under the scratch.

Another character can step in to help, giving the strongest character advantage in the check. Approximate CR is 5, two more than a normal gargoyle.",

    "A lump of enchanted patchwork flesh that turns into any of the monsters on this list with their associated ability, for 12 hours (d100 for what it turns into).",
    "A baby. For everyone else, this IS a baby; to the owner, it is a living embodiment of their own magical will. It cannot be killed by mundane or magical means, and for all intents and purposes is indestructible; but if the spellcaster is damaged, the baby is damaged (which also means, if the spellcaster dies, the baby dies). Think ‘Portrait of Dorian Gray’, kinda. Additional: a psychic link between caster and baby reveals the baby is himself–and thus, can converse with the baby/himself psychically or verbally (but the baby cannot speak, itself). It is able to move–‘crawl’–up to a few meters away, and can share what it sees with the caster. Basically, it can do baby things, and obeys commands that the caster gives it, to the physical limit of a baby. Note-slash-edit: using the baby as an object (re: ‘I’ll just go around and beat everyone with it then!’) saps the spellcaster of any goodness inside them–the more evil they become, the more blackened, bruised, and ugly the baby gets.",
    "A lion turtle (yeah, THAT lion turtle. Not super huge, as it ain’t too old yet–think ‘average tortoise’-sized. Which, I also suppose, means it’s still in it’s infancy?). Can either: hold extra spell slots for the caster, or turn one spell per day into a spell level higher (turtles’ choice–which, really, is GM’s choice), cast a random spell as needed, or finally, lets it’s owner reroll a saving throw (boost of luck).",

    "Bees. You wear their ‘queen’ in a golden amber oval around your neck; it cannot be stolen, as it has adhered to your flesh (it just LOOKS like it’s a necklace). Eating/drinking your hive’s honey imbues more magical potency. Making/drinking mead doubles it (but, it’s mead, so it’ll getcha drunk). The honey potency only applies to you, but the mead can be sold and applied to anyone–but again, it’s mead, so it’ll get them drunk.",

    "A 10 inch tall brass Golem capable of following simple instructions; it makes a happy whistling sound when it completes a task and often watches its master with great curiosity and will try to mimic them.",
    "A small pink blob like humanoid (Speed 20ft). Has the same ability of a bottomless bag, with an additional ability to act like a weak vacuum. It has low intelligence, and can only make baby noises.",
    "An animated feather that writes whatever the owner wishes in anyones’ handwriting if treated nicely and is provided ink.",
    "A small palm sized cube slime. Can be placed in any room and will relay what has been spoken when the owner holds it telepathically. It must be fed small rodents and insects daily, or it will dissolve.",

    "A finger sized eldritch deity that gives +2 necrotic dmg to rthe PC’s attacks, as well as a 10% chance to cause madness to the target of a PC’s spell for 1d4 turns. A pact must be made with it to help it seize power of a realm.",
    "A mimic that stays as the users backpack. When thrown at an enemy it attempts to devour it against a strength check. If it fails then it just does 1d4 damage and ,ust be retrieved by the PC.",
    "An invisible spirit that can’t talk. It has the mage hand spell as an ability.",
    "A large parrot that is able to translate the more common languages, but yells the translation directly into the spellcaster’s Ear.",
    "A small cat-sized Owlbear that has a natural aptitude for finding things (+1 on investigation rolls). Like most Owlbears it has a large appetite and is almost constantly hungry. If it’s left unfed for too long it tends to be temperamental (doesn’t help in investigations) and, for some reason, makes attempts to eat the shoes of the spellcaster.",
    "A Kua-toa child. Fiercely loyal to the caster and views them as a divine figure. They can manifest minor clerical powers through their devotion alone.",

    "A will-o’-wisp that has taken an interest in the spellcaster and follows them of its own free will. It is mischevious and a tad cruel by nature, and occasionally floats off for hours at a time before returning. It often zaps party members at inoppurtune times, and lingers after fights to consume the souls of the fallen. That aside, it is still supportive of the caster and readily provides backup as a distraction during truly dire combat. It occasionally acts as a guide when the spellcaster is lost, though it will sometimes play tricks on the caster in the same way. When the spellcaster is casting a spell, the will-o’-wisp circles the caster at rapid speeds, and will add an additional 2d8 of lightning damage to it if the spell also does lighting damage.",
    "A sentient transparent orb filled with smoke, that also doubles as a spellcasting focus for the caster. It communicates through movement of the smoke, with peaceful drifting indicating contentment and violent swirling indicating agitation. After gaining trust in the spellcaster over a long period of time, the spellcaster will begin to see pictures in the smoke that only they can see, which hint at the history of the orb.",
    "An oddly colored caterpillar the size of a human arm. It enjoys sunbathing on the caster’s head and eating the caster’s clothing. The caterpillar will eventually enter an unnaturally hard cocoon in which it will undergo metamorphosis into an enormous butterfly. The butterfly will continue to follow the spellcaster if they propery cared for it before its metamorphosis, and can cast Giant Insects without concentration as a spell-like ability once per day.",
    "A small, seemingly conscious cloud of blueish smoke. Can distract and hinder enemies by hovering by their mouth and nostrils, but otherwise doesn’t do much other than following it’s master.",

    "A lever with a sign that says “Pull to open” next to a locked door with an extremely poorly hid trap door right under the entrance. Pulling the lever surprisingly opens the door. If you touch the door without pulling the lever, the trap door opens.",
    "A series of regal-looking interconnected hallways are dimly lit with magical torches suspended in sconces. The entrance that the intruders come through suddenly closes itself off, and the intruders sit in silence for a few seconds. Looking down one of the other hallways reveals a slowly encroaching patch of darkness that snuffs out the torches as it makes its way forward, which relight themselves when intruders approach them while the darkness is not nearby. The intruders must search the various corridors while simultaneously avoiding the patch of darkness, which envelops and leaves no trace of anything that enters it. Any attempts to do combat with the darkness prove ineffectual, as anything that enters vanishes, never to be seen again. The darkness is semi-sentient, and the intruders can interact with it by trying to hide from it or get it to follow them. The key to escaping the hallways lies with the magic torches in the two impressively decorated sconces that the darkness can’t seem to pass by. By removing one of the special torches and carrying it with them, an intruder can hold off the darkness or even push it back. However, confronting it for too long will begin to dim the torch until it eventually snuffs out, forcing the holder to escape the darkness in order for the torch to relight. When the special torches approach the darkness from both sides of a hallway, it condenses and eventually fades, leaving a shadowy door to the outside where the last of it vanished.",
    "A roughly cut gemstone hovers ominously over a crude alter in a cavernlike room while a malicious spirit floats up around the ceiling and out of sight. New entities entering the room causes the crystal turn to face the intruders, revealing that it is actually an eye of some sort, containing a pupil that darts rapidly between the intruders and the spirit. The spirit immediately begins cajoling the crystal eye into destroying the intruders, talking to it as though it were a child in need of guidance. After a few seconds of apparent listening, the eye completely focuses on the spirit and pillars of rock begin to rapidly erupt from the room’s surfaces at points near the intruders. The pillars, while initially inaccurate, begin homing in on the intruders more and more the longer they stay still, and do 5d10 bludgeoning damage on a hit. The key to escaping the room is the crystal eye in the center of the room, which is being told by the spirit to kill the intruders. By being more persuasive than the spirit, intruders can convince the eye to stop its onslaught and eventually target the spirit instead, which will disperse after being hit multiple times with pillars of rock. The eye is very childlike in its considerations and will lose focus if the intruders fail to convince it or begin to act too impatient. Simplistic approaches work well, and the eye responds positively to constructive encouragement when it targets the intruders (That was some very good aiming, I could feel the wind rush by me! Next time though, try to aim towards the mean spirit instead, OK?). Once the spirit is destroyed, a gentle suggestion that the eye create an exit will convince it to pull a slab of rock away from a wall and reveal a passage to outside the room.",

Once removed from the jar to unlock a mysterious key hole, the once dormant hives awaken to attack whomsoever holds “their queen.”",

    "A hallway with what appear to be dart traps, or falling spike traps, or fire. There are several different hallways in a succession of 3 (so imagine three hallways one after the other with different traps, with a small room between each that could hold 4-6 people. Each hallway starts with 2 statues. The first hallway deactivates the traps by grasping one of the hands and turning it down. Once the next hallway both statues have hands that turn, and one activates the traps just cleared while the other deactivates the ones ahead (but both can’t happen so if the try to deactivate the traps ahead it will still be active). And finally the last hallway will deactivate the traps but the floor is pressure sensitive. Illustrate this by having the party see the hand start to turn back when a member starts to walk across. Essentially the first two hallways punish groups that don’t follow right behind the rogue and send him forward to handle traps, while the last hallway punishes players who just follow right behind the rogue, and are afraid to make any distance.",

They’re lined up along the walls of the hallway 5 on each side. If any of the armor or weapons are touched. Every single set of armor will come alive equipping the weapons they had, attacking the closest target immediately. The doors will also be slammed shut, slamming into anything in it’s way. The doors will only unlock if the sets of armor have been killed.",

    "A trap that is very kobold related, but could work for other creatures is this… Walking along a cliff either in a mountain/volcano or on it, a party member hits a pressure pad beneath some rubble, or dirt (depends on the environment). A harpoon shoots out and gets the member in the leg. A kobold who was waiting kicks a weight attached to a chain out and it drags the member down the side of the cliff to about 20ft above the next level (assuming they don’t pass a strength check at disadvantage). The ambush comes and there are kobolds on the lower level trying to reach the member while the party is ambushed and distracted. They will have to decide who is saving their friend and who is fighting, while the member is dangling and until he gets himself right side up is at a disadvantage to all attacks. The weight unless removed from the chain is going to disadvantage his climb (and the pain from a hook in his leg will make the climb a bit more difficult too). For ideas on how the chain looks, think of a fishing hook with a weight on it.",

Touching the door on the other side causes the stone slab that was the floor to slide into the wall, causing the player to fall into a pit of brambles, and the false log trap detaches and falls on top of them. Can be solved by throwing a rock at the door on the other side, the log will fall and create a safe bridge across the brambles.",

The walls of the well have small holes all along its length, possibly from climbing pitons. Once a certain amount of weight is applied to the rope (equivalent to two or three party members) a gelatinous cube is poured from its cell behind the stones in the wall, and seeps through the walls into the well above the players. The gelatinous cube paralyzes creatures when they touch it and fail a save. The cube happily slides down the well and consumes its prey until all organic material is digested, then it seeps through the grate at the bottom and it collected and replaced in its cell behind the stonework.",

The walls then close in and collapse all humanoids unless they pile on top of the chest, which is not crushed. The treasure chest is a mimic but is magically paralyzed until the walls fully collapse inward, at which point he mimic is released from its spell and the trap resets in 1d4 days.",

    "This is a standard pit-trap with a twist. At the bottom of the pit, and for ten feet up the walls, everything is coated in pitch. Pitch may be sticky, but in quantity it also acts like any other oil-based liquid – a lubricant. Climbing up a rope becomes extremely unlikely for whoever fell down the hole. But that’s not the worst bit. A couple of rounds after the pit trap is activated, the Kobolds, warned by a bell attached to the pit trap’s trigger, will show up with lit torches. And one of them will start combat by throwing a torch into the pit – igniting the pitch!",

And a torch. Be sure to wait until the party is most of the way across the lake before the kobolds start pouring lamp oil on the water.",
    "Kobolds are light, and armor is heavy: A well prepared Kobold always has an escape route. And his escape route is generally one only a Kobold can use. While most Kobolds choose to make tight passages that only a Tiny creature can squeeze into (thanks to their ability to fit into unlikely places), some rely on the fact that their pursuers are generally heavier, and in larger numbers, than themselves. Choose a corridor, and undermine it (dig a tunnel under the floor, but with too little material acting as floor/ceiling). Leave it just enough strength to handle the weight of a Kobold or two. Fill the corridor below with something nasty, and have it lead somewhere nasty. As a finishing touch, make sure there’s a collapsing ceiling in the upper tunnel as well to ensure that the heroes can’t climb back out after you.",
    "Gold melts at a surprisingly low temperature: Did you know that you can melt gold in a candle flame? It would probably take about an hour to do so from room temperature, but you can. More importantly, if you keep your gold coins at a hot enough temperature, they’ll melt very quickly if exposed to a very potent heat source – like say they might melt within seconds if they were doused in lamp oil and lit. This is an interesting thing to note if your chosen method of storing gold coins is in a wire-mesh cage attached to the ceiling. Especially if such a cage is kept at very high temperature, and is trapped with various kinds of flame traps (flame traps that trigger onto the gold). Unfortunately, while the temperature might be relatively high compared to the meltin point of most metal, it’s still more than enough to cook any flesh it comes in contact with (and STICK to that flesh, as molten metal tends to, causing the WORST sort of burns). And of course, the easiest way to get at the gold itself is from directly below it. Be sure to note to the party how hot it is in the room with the gold while they’re standing under it. If they’re clever enough to figure out the trap beforehand, hopefully they’re also clever enough to notice the hidden drains in the floor before all that molten gold runs (very, very quickly) down those drains.",
    "At the end of a hallway is a fake door. When the doorknob is turned, a latch is released, and the spring mounted door flies out at whoever opened the door. Since the door takes up most of the hallway, there is no chance to dodge it at all. The person who attempted to open the door takes 2d6 points of damage, and anyone standing within 5 feet of the door will take 1d6 points of damage.",

    "The character steps into the trap and the gem eyes from a roomful of statues shoots rays at him. The PC is zapped and appears to be disintegrated. A skeleton appears in his place. It’s important that the PC’s don’t get a chance to detect this trap or they’ll quickly find a solution (Search DC30). The character is teleported to a sealed tomb filled with the skeletons of various victims. A black pudding, CR equal to the party, attempts to engulf the teleported PC and turn him into a skeleton with its acid. When the trap goes off, one of these skeletons is instantly teleported to where the PC was standing, making it appear like he was disintegrated. Make a Search DC 25 to notice the skeleton (pile of bones) is not the same makeup as the PC (DC 20 if the size category of the PC is one larger or smaller than medium). After six teleportations, the “living” victims (or their remains) are teleported back to the trap area. Defeat the trap by moving statues into the area so they can be teleported, eventually sending out “victims.”",

If the party continues, they find themselves at the bottom of the underground shithouse.

    "Fortune Favors Ko-Bold – This swift monitor-style warship was commissioned for a company of Kobold privateers. Only 100 ft long, the interior of the ship is often hot and uncomfortable for medium-sized humanoids. The Fortune lies low into the waves, only revealing the raised portion of her iron hull containing a single powerful 16-inch gun, which jostles the ship when fired. The only flag the Fortune flies depicts a Kobold making a rude hand gesture. (1860-1870 timeframe)",
    "No Quarrels – This whaling ship was converted to a minelayer to combat sabotage by merfolk against fishing interests. She is armed with mines, depth charges, a harpoon gun (bow), and two scattershot swivel cannons (stern). Her sails depict a regal longsword bisecting a snapped trident. (1830-1860 timeframe)",
    "Recherche – This freight steamer was converted to a scavenger ship. Outfitted with lower-deck viewing windows, powerful hull lights, and retractable spyglasses, this ship allows its crew to scrutinize the floor of shallow waters. She is also equipped with a 3-man submarine, capable of diving to 10,000 ft. (1900-1910 timeframe).",

    "SS Firefighter – this ship looks pretty normal at first glance, but it contains a complex mechanism to take water from the ocean and pump it into large hoses, that the firefighters use to put out fires in other ships, miraculously without sinking them.",
    "The Airboat – a rather small ship without a sail, that has two giant airbags on the sides. The ship itself stays a couple meters over the surface of the water, and is maneuvered by enormous rows. It’s only advantage is that it can’t catch on fire, for it was built by a wizard.",
    "The Hourship – this small, but hella fast ship was created by a band of folk heroes who decided to make an organisation that could respond to threats in less than an hour. So, the crew is made of fearless adventurers, who scout the seas looking for pirates and evildoers, and are constantly on the lookout for anyone who needs help.",
    "Tsunami – this giant, irregular metal behemoth is feared by anyone who lives close to the sea. It is a massive steel ship, with tons of holes and chunks of metal coming from it, all with odd gadgets attached to them. It is home to deadly pirate crew rumoured to be composed of 100 men, who use their devices to effectively fight any opposition.",
    "Copan – a ridiculously large ship, that’s home to over three thousand people. It is a completely self-sustainable city, and makes little to no contact with ports. They are happy to help anyone in need though, and are capable of defending themselves against all attackers.",
    "SS Squared Sun – with a 40-man vigilante crew, this ship is constantly moving, on the lookout for unethic actions. If they see anything questionable, they capture and torture the suspects, and then decide on a sentence, that sometimes include imprisonment in the ship’s large prison.",
    "Motherboat – a steam-powered circular ship, that works as a military base. It houses several smaller ships, that the crew deploys when in combat.",
    "WaterTower – this was originally a wide and tall wizard tower, in which many magic apprentices studied. At some point, a wizard got so powerful that he could lift the entire tower, and put it on a ship. Now, it is a floating magic school, and it’s stability is only maintained by the magic powers of many residents combined.",
    "The Ark – a big, bulky ship. It’s crew is composed of a family of elders, rumoured to be several thousand years old. People who come near it say they hear all kinds of animal sounds coming from inside. It is said the ship contains one pair of each animal in the world.",

    "The Scarred Hulk – An old, weatherbeaten ship with a severely beaten, nearly unrecognizable Dwarven figurehead. The ship is actually sentient, but is so gruff and old that it rarely speaks, and then only if it has something worth saying.",
    "The Mudkip – A dainty-looking vessel decorated with gold and white paint. Rides incredibly light in the water; in the right hands, according to its captain, it can sail where canoes run aground.",
    "The Red Coquette – A small, swift caravel. The captain, an elf named Rytial Harkenouten, made a desperate deal with a Kraken decades ago. Now she tries to send as much gold to the bottom as possible to pay off her debt without being noticed.",
    "The Ruffled Pigeon – a hardy merchantman, the Pigeon has been reported sunk by storm, pirate attack, or swamping over two dozen times, but has returned home every time. The ship is patched and scuffed, but in excellent condition; sailors compete for crew openings, as they believe the ship is mystically blessed.",
    "Hearthside- This ship is outfitted and decorated with iconography of Aseraph, the Mother Goddess of Home and Peace. Hearthside is a cartel ship, a place for treaty signing and prisoner exchange. A calm emotion spell is constantly in effect on the ship and in a circle around it. It is said that every peace treaty signed on the ship lasts at least a generation.",
    "Shippy McShipface – It’s figurehead is a different ship, and it ships miniature ships all over a shipping empire that it is the flagship and mascot of. It is known as a party ship, and is definitely not known to be the most lucrative smuggling vessel on the sea.",
    "The Seal’s Fin – which has no sails above water, making it harder to spot than most vessels. It has flukes deep into the water that manipulate the currents to propel it.",
    "The Constant Comment – Was landlocked and used as a pirate tavern for some time before the owner abruptly took out the supports and dragged it out to sea, staff and patrons included.",
    "The Sweet Molly – A midsize frigate with a crew of about 40. The ship is magically enchanted so that it can appear to be any ship it has been lashed to. This makes it a smuggler’s dream, and the captain and crew will kill to keep their secret.",
    "The Barque of Frailty- This large, many-masted ship seems to be manned largely by young women, with sumptuous red sails and a doe-eyed figurehead. Sailors are thrilled to meet the Barque in the open ocean; it will come alongside a ship and offer refreshment to the crew. The Barque has a surprisingly large number of cabins, some light gambling options, and a quality bar. Sailors invariably leave the Barque notably poorer, but they don’t seem to mind.",
    "Titania – A gargantuan ship that’s nigh unsinkable. The ship is so large in fact, it has it’s own city both inside and on deck. The entire economy is self sustaining, but the captain (mayor?) is known to send out small vessels to trade with mainlanders.",
    "The Merrow’s Marrow – A completely normal ship, but it’s made of bones of all kinds. Some bones are carved, some are attached on hastily, expanding the ship ever more as it sails. The crew appears normal, but anyone who boards the ship is considered undead for the length of their voyage.",
    "The Lead Balloon – A vessel meant for air travel that never quite got off the ground. The balloon is still inflated, but is far too weak to pull the ship off the ground. The ship’s name is an insult to the original architect, who is long since passed.",
    "Ta’ Garge Barge – A ship that was meant to be a way to send off a metropolis’ waste, but was quickly transformed into a pirate vessel by a hoarder with a lust for power as soon as it crossed the horizon. It resembles a haphazard mess of garbage that somehow still floats, and victims of their plundering often smell it before they can see it. The captain and crew are very, very susceptible to bribing in the means of junk for their collection.",
    "The SS Aloe – A ship made by elves, for elves. Beautifully crafted in various greens and golds, with a high fee for those using their services as a traveling ship. Elves, however, get on for free, often describing their non-elven companions as pets so they are able to board. Non-elven passengers are stored in a separate lobby below deck.",
    "The Drow’s Bow – A small dingey with no sails and no crew. A single porthole in the center leads down to a large sub-marine base, filled with and beloved by the undesirables of society. Adventures talk about this ship and their warm time there, filled with laughs, good food, and good stories.",
    "The Open Clam – A sea brothel with all kinds of races and genders. Pleasure guaranteed for everyone.",
    "The Stalwart – This former blockade runner has seen better days. In a prior life, The Stalwart could have been a ferry ship. In her final chase, her crew sacrificed everything into her fiery engines. Anything that wasn’t essential to function or bolted to the ground was used as fuel to maintain full steam. A dark discoloration marks where there should be benches, the quarters are bare, and floorboards on the upper decks are ripped out. With 100 meters of full dilapidation, The Stalwart has yet to be adopted by any sane crew; however, she is still capable of voyages. (1850-1870 timeframe)",
    "The Ranger – This fine warship of dwarvish construction has been tested through a baptism of fire. The anti-piracy ship was launched a year ago. In her first battle, she and her ally, The Rot escorted a convoy of merchant ships through deep pirate waters, engaging ships almost daily. Capable of reaching 25 knots, The Ranger is swift enough maintain speed with any merchant ship. She is 160 meters long with a steel hull and is armed with twin 10-inch guns facing front and two independent 7.5-inch guns facing rear. (1900-1910 timeframe)",
    "The Rot – This armed steamer is known for the horrid stench of its smoke. Manned by exclusively goblins and hobgoblins, The Rot excels in chaotic and brutal battles. At 100 meters long, her steel hull is reinforced and tipped at the bow, forming a powerful battering ram. She is armed with two independent flamethrowers at the bow and a rear-facing 10-inch gun. (1890-1900 timeframe)",
    "The Placeholder- A large, grey ship with neat sails and trimmed rigging, the Placeholder is an excellent ship for passage or trade. Captained by Cadwallader Farer, a trim man in a blue greatcoat, and by Oliver Shan, his large, peg-legged First Mate, the Seafarer and its crew are just what you would expect from such a boat; in fact, almost too much so. This is because all of it- the boat, the captain, etc.- is illusory, weaved from shadow-stuff. The only truly real things aboard the boat are the other passengers, who are unaware of the nature of the boat- except for one, Jeronimy Blackprebble, a gnomish wizard and master illusionist. Jeronimy created the Placeholder out of whole cloth, and is very much enjoying his success. He loves that the passengers can’t even tell, and if confronted, will act coy for a little, than gleefully confess and expect to be lauded for his mighty achievement. Jeronimy is a good sort who can take most things in stride- however, should the players be dangerously confrontational to him or the other passengers, he will unmake the portion of the boat they are standing on, moving them to the brig, or if too dangerous, to the ocean below.",
    "The Quiet Hand- A slaver ship, itself manned entirely by slaves. The captain is Itzaas the Moran, a large man with many tattoos and a prominent brand on his chest and neck; he is a slave just like his crew. The true owner of the ship is a consortium of trade wizards who have never seen the ship in person. Itzaas has plenty of leeway; at the moment, he has chosen to focus primarily on Elven slaves. He has two dozen currently in the hold, including 17 drow from a raiding party who found the Hand more than they could handle.",
    "The Gorgon – An imposing Man-O-War, The Gorgon has since come under the captaincy of the vicious Tabaxi known as Lief the Purple. The sails are striped gold and purple, atop of which flies her dreaded black flag depicting a white skull with a crown of snakes. Her cannons are wreathed in carved brass snakes, and reaching out from her prow is the wicked torso and terrifying scowling face of a hideous Gorgon.",
    "The HMS Gryffon – Commanded by Commodore Montagu Knight, His Majesty’s Ship Gryffon is a 74-gun frigate who’s white sails pale only in comparison to Commodore Knight’s white powdered wig. Loyal to the Crown, the Gryffon does not shy away from a fight, as her clean hull gracefully cuts through even the most formidable seas. A gift from the King himself, her golden anchor is a sight to behold.",
    "The Toucan – This re-purposed merchant ship has become a sloop-of-war. Her colourfully striped hull is almost comedic, however what this ship lacks in grace, and austerity, she more than makes up for with agility and speed. The Toucan is affectionately captained by Red Jeyne, an equally flamboyant female elf, who is in the employ of Governor Sudcliffe and aims to prove herself as a most opportune privateer… Having quickly pulled off many daring deeds and maneuvers on the open sea, she is beginning to make a name for herself and The Toucan.",
    "Harthaq Grinuul (‘The Cleaver of the Horizon’ in Tide Dwarven) – Little is known of Tide Dwarves; more reclusive even then their Mountain Cousins, their pale blue skin and green-brown hair makes them resemble tiny storm giants. They are brutally self-sufficient and tend to avoid other races- but, like all Dwarves, they are more than prepared should war find them. Harthaq Grinuul is a Quadrireme Warship, with both sails and rows for oarsmen. By means of an ingenious technical design, sets of oars are locked apart, allowing a Dwarven oarsman to power two oars at a time- one via arms, the other via feet. This, combined with the wind and wave magic the Dwarves have developed, allows the ship to obtain speeds human sailors can only dream of. The ship’s figurehead, a Dwarven Maiden with a mighty Bearded Greataxe, is strong and sharp enough to allow for the ramming attacks the ship is built for; Tide Dwarves do not take prisoners, and prefer to avoid contact rather than skirmish. When they fight, they intend to leave none alive.",
    "The Century Hawk – A crappy looking cargo skiff with a charismatic captain and an unkempt Tabaxi first mate who speaks no common. The captain claims the ship is fast but his boasts make no sense. A second inner hull allows goods to be smuggled in secret compartments.",
    "The Winged Gourmet – an incredibly fast light cargo ship (of exotic woods and, if available in world, plated with a very thin metal (cooper historically, mythril if available) underneath to prevent barnacles) specialising in transport of small quantities of perishable and fine foodstuffs. The captain, Ilsaril, is a refined but personable male elf with a small wizardry talent and prodigious cooking skills and honed sense of taste and smell. He is a renowned tough but fair negotiator. His navigator Lisbet is a young human woman with scars on the left hand side of her face which she covers with long dark hair. She speaks little but is a skilled assassin. The ships boat is called A Pinch of Spice.",
    "Sandy’s Folly – a cargo ship crewed by just one man and a golem, although it was designed for more. Nobody knows who ‘Sandy’ is, nor how the ship manages to make a profit, nor how it always seems to know how to avoid/escape trouble.",
    "The Nemesis – an armored frigate with an ironclad hull. Having a small number of large cannons, the ship’s primary offense involves ramming into enemy ships.",
    "The Dreadnought – A massive ancient vessel, rumored to be crewed by ghosts. Moves faster than any other known ship in the Material Plane and legends say that it is propelled by magic instead of sails.",
    "Naginata – class vessel – A warship designed by the master shipwrights of the Far East. Can be crewed by 150 men. Costs 5x as much GP to buy compared to a normal warship. Can move 1.5x as fast and is equipped with two ballistae and numerous sea mines.",
    "The Anex – Although it is just a small caravel, this airship earned its legendary status when the gorgon Karametha took up residence within. An engineer and wicked necromancer, she built a terrible device capable of dropping shells charged with the mortal souls of those she takes captive, unleashing devastating blasts below while her ornithopters swoop down to take captives up to her deck, replacing her enslaved crew or becoming fodder for her weapon.",
    "Ossa Mare – An ancient, massive ship with a city of sea pirates upon her back. She is a living being, some say the avatar of a sea god, and those who live upon her dedicate their lives to teaching the crafts of ship building and weather control.",
    "The White Pearl – A 90ft long ship with a matching pair of massive white sails. The deck holds 6 cannons on rails that would rotate around to the proper side of the ship. Sailors pass on tails of how the cannons can fire from 40 nautical miles.",
    "A.G.S. Noble Forte – Five masts, square rigged with spanker and proper foremast. Heavily armed freebooter interdiction platform also housing a small detachment of marines for the occasional brown water operation.",
    "A.G.S Heatherleigh – Four masts, triangular foresail rigged on a longer than usual bowsprit. Weatherly and seaworthy, she’s one of the fastest ships on the open ocean when her captain, Cyrus von Altibene, can run her close-hauled. His crew is well-seasoned and loyally follows him into any fight against the corsairs that continuously pressure their home port, Askeltoft.",
    "K.G.S. Battlespite – An older barque with a storied history of guarding the deepwater harbor at Kuhnmouth. Nearly scuttled when Maelpsirath emerged from its Rite of Becoming and subsequently upgraded with much more effective anti-ship ballistae.",
    "Ban Sidhe – Six-masted passenger schooner. Fast and luxurious and her crew are cordial, professional hosts. Normally features a rotating complement of regionally prominent bards as entertainment.",
    "Flayer’s Wave – Famous for once escaping the Askeltoft flotilla while yet fully loaded with plunder, this lateen rigged three-masted brigantine was built long and narrow with a deeper than usual draft. She’s capable of heeling almost to the gunwales in order to tack more aggressively than perhaps any other ship under difficult wind conditions. Carries no visible mounted weapons above deck.",
    "Crosswing – This blue-water caravel is almost an institution on the Tefield-Kuhnmouth inshore route. A suspected freebooter ship, she’s been repainted and reflagged so many times that the navy’s running joke is about her impressive wardrobe. Her beams are rotten to the bilges though. It’s only a matter of time before she’s aground or sprung a last, fatal leak in her hold.",
    "Vannivar – Has a reputation for being cursed, but her captain and crew are affable and well-liked. Of course, they’re the fifth crew in as many years, but it’s probably a coincidence. Pirate vessel with an expanded bilge used as smuggling space.",
    "Pistonram – This ship has been upgraded by dendromancers to use fin-like propulsors just below the waterline in becalmed seas. Consequently, her crew has made considerable coin as they’re almost the only ones willing to attempt the South Passage around the Gyrewild and its otherwise lethal effects on the easterly wind currents at that latitude.",
    "Sam Tick – Dhow-rigged brig. Common style corsair vessel. Cap’n Westley Voshel is well known in the community and always has his beers bought for him when anchored at Freedock Hold",
    "First of Infinite – This famous pirate vessel is partially crewed by seagoing minotaur and partially by mixed humanoids. It is the only ship known for this split crew arrangement. Somehow despite the obvious cultural divide, Cap’n Grace Hayashi has united and forged them into a murderously effective crew. She’s begun arming the two upper middle decks with Gnomish experimental blackpowder cannons–eighty of them to starboard, eighty to port–to supplement broadsides of heavy arbalests on the upper and main decks. It’s an event every time this lethal ship pulls into port. Nominal crew complement of 160.",
    "Swift Vengeance – Captained by Tabitha the Butcher, this mighty pirate vessel commands fear and respect all throughout Tohs Abyss from Nightgarm Freehold in the north to beyond the Wall, a thousand leagues to the south. Her upper and main decks are either ornamental cherrywood or they’ve been stained with blood so many times the wood has taken on a crimson appearance. Rumors abound about this ship’s disciplinary cannibalism practices. More than one barge convoy has scuttled itself and fled aboard its escort based on this reputation alone. Flies a long, dark grey pennant.",
    "Vesper Regalia – Repurposed corvette bought as naval surplus fourteen years ago. Light and square-rigged with extra-tall masts of ironwood, she’s capable of scrambling aboard her own bow wave and practically sprinting downwind. Suspected pirate vessel, but never yet confirmed officially.",
    "A.C. Victorianus – a tiereme with two masts and three sets of rows. On the front there is ram of iron for crushing other ships hulls and on the bow of the ship, a small siege tower is built up on deck, sporting a balista that is able to shoot flaming darts or pots filled with burning tar.",
    "Stonehewer- a dwarfen ironclad with 10 cannons each side and a bombard (artillery) in the front of the steelmade battleship. It has two masts, though the main source of propulsion comes from a gnomish invention. The demonic power reactor that turns modern screws. This ship is far superior than all the other ships on the oceans at this time. With her sistership Iron Maiden, they are the only real naval power the dwarfs and the gnomes have. Though they are each as strong as a fleet on their own.",
    "Weatherlight – an airship of some prestige, known to be the fastest and most agile air cruiser there is. Her Captain, Hannah is rumored to be the best airship captain in this world.",
    "Airship Yamato – the biggest airship ever built, comes from an eastern Empire and has the most impressive armament of all time. Apart from uncountable cannons on deck, hidden in the bow of the ship, is a 46 cm canon, that is rumored to split mountains. No one has ever seen this ship in actiom, though the rumors are steadily spreading about the colossus in the sky.",
    "Casterly’s Prize – A modest sailing vessel that once been owned by an ostentatious wizard. The boat was lost at sea, but if it is encountered is in filled with both mundane and dangerous enchantments and traps. Also contains a small chest of magical treasure.",
    "The Grim Jackdaw – A boat that appears (because of an extremely low middeck) to be always sinking. It is sailed by a group of hardened escaped slaves, who capture and attempt to ransom any rescue parties.",
    "The Sir’s Prize – A ship created as part of a large-scale treasure hunt for the sons of rich noble magi. The Prize is a prize ship, crewed by actors who will put up token resistance, but will break character if any real damage is threatened. It is in some very out of the way place.",
    "Scrack’s Scuttler- appears to be a strangely carved and painted vessel. Actually a Reclusivary Cuttlefish, a strange and rare species related to the Kraken. The ‘ship’ is in fact built into the beast’s shell. Captain Scrack, a goblin with ‘VERMIN’ burned into his cheek, has befriended the creature; the beast has a symbiotic relationship with the captain and his crew.",
    "The Dread Burg – A large battleship, built entirely out of ice and crewed by Frost Giants and their thralls. From afar, it appears as a normal iceberg.",
    "The Algalita – a small fast sailing vessel with the main mast being an actual living tree. The ship is captained by a human druid who sails around punishing any ships or ports that would spoil the ocean by dumping pollution.",
    "The Miss Fortune – A pirate brig, well armed and swift, it seems cursed. Currently it is infested with Goliath bird eating spiders, the wait in the rigging and leap out at passing sea gulls, reminiscent of a World War 2 Destroyer shooting down incoming dive bombers. In addition, a howler monkey has taken over the Crow’s nest and it’s his now. The curse seems to extend to everyone who sets foot and ensures that the ship will sail head first into any random encounter that the gods of fate think will be most ‘exciting,’ ‘dangerous,’ and ‘challenging.’ It is also instantly recognizable and is hated when arriving in port, partly due to the Howler Monkey bellowing at all times of the night and day, partly for the spider infestation, and partly for the smell of the Swedish Valhund mascot and the capybara ‘Francis’ that lives below decks and will leap over board to happily swim at every port stop.",
    "The Big Ogly – A slow, dark, hulk of a ship. It is made with a two-part hull, with a metal-filled slip between two wooden hulls. The ship is sturdy and tough and slow, with a rolling, syncopated gait. Originally named Great Oggestriantate, but no one calls it that.",
    "The Countervail – A mid-sized Corvette, turned into a mail ship. The sails seem oddly backwards, but the ship sails normally.",
    "The Widow’s Blush – A pirate caravel, with black hull and black sails. The ship is enchanted such that any non-black paint sloughs off, and sails slowly turn black within a day of being hung. The ship’s crew is grim and brooding, partly due to their dark atmosphere.",
    "The Green Witch – A large merchant ship. A strange spell on the ship has put the left half 12 hours behind the other half- it is night when the right half is day. Sailors say it takes two weeks to get used to the change.",
    "Saffron – A thin yellow catamaran with bright sails. Toghe Drummond, a half-elven explorer, is the owner and captain of the ship, and he and his wife and children live on the boat. There is a trapdoor in the floor of the catamaran that leads to an impossibly large (for the boat) cabin, the size of a modest 5-room house.",
    "The Fish Wagon – A small vessel, filled with halfling pilgrims of Yondalla. They offer free passage to any halflings headed in the same direction. The ship is comfortable and homey for small folk- bigger visitors smack against bulkheads and must stoop through doors and passageways.",
    "The Orchard of La’Clemant – An abandoned tub called the Nancy Tremaine was repurposed by an eccentric island druid, who had been shipwrecked for three years. The Orchard is now almost completely filled with Roselemon trees (the Roselemon is a tangy pink fruit with a taste like raspberry lemonade- delicious!). La’Clemant offers fruit to any ship he happens across, warning of the dangers of scurvy.",
    "The Dewdreamer – A beautiful clipper, now looking a little haggard and ragged. The ship belongs to Lady Zisten, an elven woman who began as a star-struck adventurer and now is a pirate and slaver. The ship, like her captain, seems filled with dashed hopes and a creeping loss of morality.",
    "The Wooden Ingot – A ship infested with Rust Quivers, an amphibious form of rust monster. The ship is made entirely from wood and stone, and anyone travelling on it is warned to keep all metal in a stone strongbox. If the ship is attacked, the captain will unleash Rust Quivers on the attacking ship.",
    "The Black Opal – A frigate constructed from a rare wood that gleams like an Opal. It’s commanded by a Half Elf Bard and a crew of friendly skeletons which obey his every word – provided he is playing a soothing tune.",
    "Old Unfaithful – A piece of driftwood that was ridden by a halfling to escape an island they were deserted on. After returning to society he used his noble status to pull some strings and have it officially recognized as a seaworthy vessel with its own paid for spot to reside at, in the harbour.",
    "WaveDasher – This small ship is only large enough for one rider, but it can go faster than the speed of sound with a capable captain, unfortunately it has no defensive capabilities but it can be used to bash into other ships at high velocity due to the high strength living wood it is made out of that also serves as a way for the boat to regenerate itself.",
    "The Anex – Although it is just a small caravel, this airship earned its legendary status when the gorgon Karametha took up residence within. An engineer and wicked necromancer, she built a terrible device capable of dropping shells charged with the mortal souls of those she takes captive, unleashing devastating blasts below while her ornithopters swoop down to take captives up to her deck, replacing her enslaved crew or becoming fodder for her weapon."

Often times they are twisted ones. The wearer also gains inspiration for successfully tricking, riddling, or pranking others as well as for killing. This effect stacks. Once per day, If the wearer is hit, they can choose to roll a Charisma Save. If successful they can laugh off the damage, no matter how painful it was.",
    "The Mask of Manipulation: This porcelain mask is serious. Its eye sockets are straight and focussed. A 9 pointed star is carved into the forehead, and the lips of the mask are made of a very exotic material. This mask allows the wearer to cast Modify Memory once per WEEK, and Zone of Truth once per DAY, and friends AT WILL. This mask also grants the wearer the Awakened Mind Warlock trait. This mask has a special ability in which the wearer may command the mask to cast Ultimate Modify Memory which is the same as Modify Memory but effects any intelligent creatures of the wearer’s choice up to a max radius of 1 Mile (no saves required).

    "Mask of Swarms: The mask resembles a giant locust head, recreated in remarkable detail. A close look reveals that it was created using the exoskeletons and body parts of millions of other bugs. When worn, insects, bugs, spiders, roaches, and any other creepy crawlies emerge, creating a swarm that engulfs the wearer’s body. The swarming bodies make the wearer more difficult to target and absorb damage. (Adds 20 Temporary HP, and, when worn during the day, adds 1 to AC. When worn at night or underground, imposed disadvantage on attacker).",
    "Mask of Brutality – This mask resembles a growling devil’s face shaped from a single piece of a dark grey metal, save that the eyes and mouth are covered by bars like a prison cell. The mask, when put on, immediately deals 1d8 damage to the wearer as sharp needles pierce the skull and begin pumping a potent alchemical mixture of growth hormones and other substances into the cranial cavity, fiendish in nature. 2d6 rounds afterwards, the wearer gains a +5 boost to STR as their muscles bulge and swell, and their bones thicken. However, the mixture introduced into the wearer’s body results in an equal penalty to INT, reducing the wearer to a drooling, beastly hulk. Removing the mask deals 2d8 damage to the wearer as the needles tear free of the skull; the effects of the mask wear off after a long rest.",

    "Mask of the godmaker: The name of the mask is never capitalised when referred to, as while the being within the mask has godlike powers, every being who knows about it will agree that it is no god. The mask itself is seemingly unremarkable, a multi coloured mask which looks like it was made of paper mache by a child, and painted haphazardly. However, when worn, the wearer will come into contact with a power being that will grant any one wish to the wearer. However, the wish will be granted as broken as possible, similar to a djinn or genie, causing the wearer to slowly transform into a powerful beast that is themed around their wish, bent on destruction of everything they held dear, while screaming praises to the godmaker.",
    "Mask of the Godbreakers: a mask that is wrought out of cast iron, and has the symbol of a large hammer embossed on the front. The mask belongs to a line of hunters that are bent of challenging the godmaker, usually consisting of loved ones of the godmaker’s chosen. When wearing the mask, the wearer can tap into the memories of those who had ever worn one of these masks, not just the mask they wear, as well as provide a mental link to others who wear the mask, allowing for a group of hunters to work in tandem perfectly. Said to be made from an older shattered mask, there are only a handful in existence.",
    "Mask of the Blinded One: a mask that resembles a bat, but is badly made, with the face being malformed, and the ears taking up much of the mask. When worn, the user loses all sight, and instead, is given the ability of perfect echolocation, being able to see with sound.

When worn,anyone who makes eye contact with the mask is unable to break eye contact, while no matter which direction they look at the mask from, it looks like they are still making eye contact.

User can cause the mask to ‘blink’, even though the mask lacks an eyelid, breaking eye contact with everyone, but stunning them for a round.",
    "Mask of the Forgotten Friend: A featureless mask, similar in colour to pale skin. Has no hole for eyes, nose or mouth, but allows the user to function as if not wearing a mask at all when worn.

False memories can be implanted by suggestion from the wearer, but takes considerable skill to do well. If worn for too long, wearer can suffer from dissociative identity disorder or depersonalisation disorder, among other things.",

    "Face of the Arbiter: A delicate clay mask without holes, shaped in such a way that it requires no straps in order to be worn. The face on the mask is stern and emotionally neutral, with sharp red lines accenting the hard edges and sweeping curves of the otherwise bland white face piece. While the mask is being worn by it’s bound owner, they are able to see through the covered eyes of the mask. The owner is able to detect a consciously made lie made in their presence, though lies made unknowingly and lies of omission are not detected in this way. If the bound owner asks a direct question to a single creature, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against a DC of 8 + the owner’s proficiency modifier + the owner’s Wisdom modifier or be compelled to truthfully answer the question to the best of their knowledge. In addition, the wearer of the mask is unable to knowingly speak a lie, directly or through omission. The supernatural properties of the mask can only be used by a single person, someone who had a part of their face removed and used in the making of the mask. A part can take the form of a small chunk of skin and flesh, a few teeth, or even a nose or an eye. The part is mixed into the mask, binding the article to the donator and making it so that the power of the mask can only be used by them. Upon the bound owner’s death, the magic is severed and mask becomes a normal face piece.",
    "Face of the Harvester: A delicate clay mask without holes, shaped in such a way that it requires no straps in order to be worn. The face on the mask is steadfast and peaceful, with orange, yellow, and green lines forming simple yet appealing patterns across the earthy tones of the brow and cheeks. While the mask is being worn by it’s bound owner, they are able to see through the covered eyes of the mask. The owner is able to identify and harvest plants with greater clarity and efficiency, giving the wearer advantage and doubling their proficiency modifier on Nature and Survival ability checks to understand and collect vegetation, so long as the wearer has proficiency in that skill. If the wearer does not have proficiency in one or both of the skills, they do not benefit from the mask’s bonus to that particular skill. In addition, the bound owner is more likely to receive a fruitful harvest while wearing the mask. If the bound owner harvests a plant while wearing the mask, the freshness and potency of the plant is extended for one and a half times the duration it would otherwise last. If the owner has actively and personally cultivated the growth of the plant, the freshness and potency of the plant is instead extended for twice its original duration. The supernatural properties of the mask can only be used by a single person, someone who had a part of their face removed and used in the making of the mask. A part can take the form of a small chunk of skin and flesh, a few teeth, or even a nose or an eye. The part is mixed into the mask, binding the article to the donator and making it so that the power of the mask can only be used by them. Upon the bound owner’s death, the magic is severed and mask becomes a normal face piece.",
    "Le Masque Noirci: This wooden mask covers the upper half of the face and has a few shallow scratches over the left eye that cannot be removed or fixed, no matter who or what tries to fix it. The mask was most likely originally stained either jet black or a dark purple, but the color has faded over time. While worn, the owner cannot discern between different colors, seeing the world only in shades of black and white. That said, they receive an empowered darkvision that can pierce through even magical darkness, even if things can only be seen in black and white. Said darkvision extends out to 60 ft., but if the wearer possesses normal darkvision that extends farther, the effects will carry out to that distance. If the wearer of the mask attempts to look directly at anything emitting a light, they will suffer from temporary blindness that lasts for 15 to 30 seconds as a result. According to an old journal entry found with the mask, repeated attempts to look at light sources will increase the blindness time exponentially, to the point where the effect is permanent.",
    "Face of the Terrified: A papier-mâché mask, vaguely resembling the face of a wide-eyed screaming humanoid. To work properly, this mask must be bound to over the course of a day, worn 24 hours by the desired owner. While the mask is being worn by an unbound owner, they find average things frightening and receive disadvantage on saving throws against the Frightened status. While the mask is being worn by a bound owner, they are instilled with a strange sense of courage, receiving advantage on saving throws against the Frightened status. Also, once per day, the user may cast the spell Cause Fear as a 1st level spell without expending a spell slot. While casting the spell, the mask contorts and emits a high pitched screech, layered over the wearer’s own yelling.",

    "Surgical Mask: gain advantage on any medicine checks.",
    "Mask of the Hanged Man: A burlap sack around which hangs a noose. Upon putting on the mask, the rope tightens considerably, though not enough to choke the wearer. The fabric is ordinary sackcloth with a pair of scant eyeholes crudely torn into the front. The wearer must succeed in a DC15 Will save or become overcome with despair, suffering disadvantage on skill checks. Wearer can command the rope to attempt to grapple foes with advantage as a bonus action. Long term exposure to the mask causes 1d6 psychic damage per hour. Upon reaching 0 from this damage, the wearer simply becomes comatose, unwilling to move or take any action. Removal of the mask requires a will save of 15. This rough sack was the last thing that some condemned soul saw. As it hung with the recently dead, keeping them company as the carrion birds found them, it absorbed some malign energy.",

If the user’s speed reaches 0, they are petrified and turned into marble.",
    "The Planar Visor – An obsidian mask with diamonds worth 100 gp each in the eye sockets. Wearing the mask and speaking the name of a plane of existence will allow the wearer to see into that plane through the eyes of the mask for 2d4 hours.

Old blood mixed with dark grease oozes from the barbs, and when the weapon is swung in battle, the serrated edge rocks back and forth to chew through flesh and bone, spewing noxious smoke into the air. A horrific weapon created from nightmare, a Flesh Grinder is alive with malevolence, filled with an unspeakable thirst for blood and flesh.

People who sharpen edged weapons on it hear what sounds like an army of insect voices calling for blood and vengeance, no one else hears anything.

They will ricochet off objects or even curve their own path to strike and slay whoever the shooter wills. One shot, one kill, always.

    "Bag of Luck – A seemingly ordinary leather bag with no markings or sinister aura whatsoever. It is secured by a thong long enough to go over a person’s head, and will not open until someone places the thong around their neck. Inside the Bag of Luck are 24 pearlescent beads that smell delicious and seem almost to glow with their own light. Each bead is exactly one hour of luck, 12 good, 12 bad. There is no way to determine which is which without eating it and activating it. When under the effect of a good luck bead the user cannot fail in anything involving an element of luck. In game terms, every single die roll the user makes will be a critical success. When under the effects of a bad luck bead the user cannot succeed in anything involving an element of luck. In game terms every single die roll will be a critical failure. Any attempt to use logic or trickery to determine which beads are which by, for example taking one bead and seeing that it was bad luck and then eating all the remaining 23 on the theory that the good luck will counterbalance the bad luck, will backfire. In that example what the user took for bad luck initially will all turn out to have long term positive effects and taking all the remaining beads will result in catastrophe and possibly death from ill fortune. The bag cannot be taken from the user’s neck until all beads are eaten. Any attempt to remove the bag before then will result in the bag tightening around the user’s neck and strangling them until they stop trying to remove it. If the beads are not all used within 72 hours the bag will strangle and kill the user. Do you feel lucky?",
    "The Essay of Eris – A seemingly ordinary sheet of paper or parchment. Anyone reading it will see believable, plausible, and totally false, evidence that those closest to them are conspiring against them to kill or enslave them or worse. The contents may appear to be a personal letter from one person to another, a report from a rival agency, or whatever else would be most likely to cause the reader to think their friends or allies had betrayed them. There is no magic coercion; the reaction of the reader is entirely a matter of how paranoid they are. A normal person with no reason to think they have enemies it might dismiss its claims entirely. But if put into a delicate situation where betrayal is likely it can cause civil wars, bring down spy agencies, and turn a room of distrustful conspirators into a howling mob with each person seeking to kill all the others.",
    "Eyespikes of Sithrax – Two iron spikes with stains from old blood. When driven into the eyes of a victim with a hammer, killing the victim they will ignite and over the course of ten minutes all flesh will burn from the victim’s skull. It is now a Burning Skull of Sithrax and is continuously aflame about as hot as a normal fireplace fire. The Burning Skull of Sithrax will answer four questions 100% accurately, 100% honestly, and as unhelpfully as possible. When not answering questions the Burning Skull of Sithrax screams curses, threats, and describes in horrifying detail the tortures that Sithrax will inflict on all in earshot. After the fourth question is asked and answered the Burning Skull of Sithrax will consume itself and turn to ash after ten minutes of screaming the deepest and darkest secrets of the last person to ask it a question to anyone who can hear. Afterward the Eyespikes of Sithrax revert to their inert state and can be driven into the eyes of another victim.",
    "Siphon of Asmodeus – A gleaming silver chain about three feet long with a golden disk on one end and a copper disk on the other. It allows the person holding the golden disk to transfer injury, age, illness, tiredness, or any other negative condition to the person touching the copper disk. Any injury, regardless of severity or age, can be transferred. A person missing an arm could transfer that to the person on the copper end causing the victim to lose their arm while the person holding the gold disk regained their arm. Given a supply of victims a person with the Siphon of Asmodeus could theoretically live forever, in perpetual youth and perfect health. The most insidious aspect of the Siphon is that there are no downsides at all to the person benefiting. Their health is not creepy; their youth is not waxy. Using the Siphon is not painful to either the victim or the user, though obviously the victim may feel pain from whatever injuries or age are transferred to them. This, of course, encourages the owner to use it and by doing so spread misery and damn themselves.",
    "Demonbone Bow – The Demonbone Bow was crafted by the Church of Heavenly Light, a sect of fanatic demon hunting crusaders who believed that the ends justify the means and that demons deserved whatever fate they got. Made from bones and sinew extracted from a dozen living demons flayed and suspended from blessed chains while the Church did its grisly work. The bow is a weapon made specifically to kill demons, and it does the job quite well. Even when normal arrows are shot from the bow it does quadruple damage to demons, and when using arrows made from demon bone it will slay any common demon with a single hit, and do ten times normal damage even to demon lords. Those who use the bow become sadistic, careless ending of life in the name of their cause, and soon seek only the most brutal and agonizing means of achieving their goals. Whether this is due to the corrupting influence of the material from which the bow is made, or from the zealotry that went into its construction is an open question.",
    "The Tongue of Beelzebub – Appearing as a desiccated human tongue, if a sufficiently devoted (or deranged) person cuts out their own tongue and replaces it with the Tongue of Beelzebub the tongue will become living and work like a normal tongue. Once installed the Tongue of Beelzebub allows the user to lie perfectly. The user gains a large bonus to any skill related to lying, conning, deceit or any other illicit act involving speech. Lying becomes so natural, so second nature, to the user that within a week they must make an effort of will to tell the truth in any situation (in game terms, they need to pass a Will check that becomes increasingly difficult with each month of use). The user also gains an insatiable thirst for human blood, needing to drink the final drops of blood from the heart of a debauched liar, drunkard, or other sinful person every two weeks or they will begin to suffer effects identical to dying of thirst and will, in fact, die after two weeks and three days without blood. There is no way to get the necessary blood without killing a ‘sinful’ person. After one year of use, the person cannot speak the truth under any circumstances at all and loses the ability to discern reality from fantasy or truth from lies. They say whatever they think will benefit them the most in that moment with no regard at all for its truth or falsehood and those who hear them speak tend to believe them even if they contradict themselves. After two years of use the person tells lies to themselves, believing themselves to be the greatest, the best, the most amazing, and their ego grows to make them incapable of believing that anyone can do anything at all better than them. Most users die shortly after this, having convinced themselves that they can fly, or that they can defeat a giant in single combat, or other deadly tasks. The Tongue is currently held by a group of Beelzebub cultists who worship its user as the voice of Beelzebub on Earth and believe that the truth of the cosmos and other great things can be discerned from the lies if only one is clever enough to do so. Despite the fact that most who use the Tongue die after only two years there is always great competition among the devotees of Beelzebub to become its next bearer.",

By the light of a magical smokeless candle they are very proud of, they beckon you down a hatch in the bottom of their casket to a small hidden cave. The cave, though dimly lit, is actually very homey. The walls are lined with over full, wooden bookcases, stacks of books line a narrow path to a comfortable chair. The youth explains that hundreds of years ago, they grew tired of being accused of vampirism just because they are immortal (they are very dismissive of the fact that they are immortal and don’t seem to know the source of their immortality themselves). They decided to gather as many books as they could, use the money they had put aside to construct this secret room and buy a comfortable coffin, then fake their death. Hundreds of years later they definitely don’t regret their decision, only pausing briefly before offering the party a quest for more books to fully restock the youth’s “library”, along with whatever reward is offered, the party gets all of the old books to do with as they please, as well as a small volume of surprisingly well written fanfiction.",

During your efforts to excavate the coffin, you find splintered wood, investigation of the wood reveals it to be from a coffin. Digging further down towards the rest of the coffin, you find a huge, hunched, mishapen skeleton. It appears, though twisted, to be posed as if it had been the one lain to rest in the coffin. Other uncovered parts of the coffin appear to be normal humanoid sized; coinpurse, tatters of clothing, even what remains of a pair of shoes near the huge skeleton’s feet are medium sized. Some jewelry lies broken among the bones, a necklace emanating fading transmutation magic near the skeleton’s neck with its chain snapped and two rings split from the inside laying upon the finger bones.

You can see the limbs twitching and trying to move, but as more flesh and muscle rots away, the efforts are weaker and weaker. After almost a full minute of this, the youth can no longer move any of its body except for its eyes and what remains of its face. Its eyes dart around, you can tell that it is intelligent but clearly terrified and in maddening agony. Any healing magic seems to cause it even more pain, and it is impossible to put it out of its misery. Eventually it rots to nothingness.",

If the owner or gallery manager is there, if asked: explains that a possessed child made this, and then promptly died.",

Some seem organized, others seem strewn about, as if the artist wanted you to think someone was purposefully looking for something. It looks like it takes place in an attic.

He is smiling, a full-toothed pearly white smile–not a grimace, not a grim grin, not an evil grin, as noted by his cheeks and eyebrows. He is happy. There is a twinkle, non-animated, in his brown eyes. The only other aspect of this picture is the brown carved pipe that this man has in his clenched teeth–it is jutting out at the viewer’s left. It is not smoking, but could seemingly be used for such an activity. If any party member is under the influence–of anything–and views this image, trippy razor rainbows surround the head, hypnotizing the viewer, as they stand and stare slack-jawed at the portrait for the remainder of whatever they’re under the influence of.",

    "This painting looks like it may have once adorned a wall in a very high-class establishment dedicated to the pleasures of the flesh.

It is the daughter of a local lord which disappeared on a night of a full moon some time ago. Rumor has it she fell victim to lycanthropes, which are now hunted viciously by the lords men.
